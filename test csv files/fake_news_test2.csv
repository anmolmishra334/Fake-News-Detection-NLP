6109,CLINTON VISITS NORTH CAROLINA IN CAMPAIGN TRAIL RETURN TRUMP UP IN POLLS,greensboro nc reuters  hillary clinton got back on the campaign trail on thursday after taking three days off for pneumonia and the democratic presidential candidate faced a more challenging political landscape with republican rival donald trump rising in opinion polls senior clinton aides said they always expected the race to the nov  election to be close but it was clear from a raft of new polls that trump had halted a summer swoon after taking steps to give a less freewheeling more polished performance on the stump clinton  appeared in good health on a visit to her campaign planes press cabin while flying to greensboro north carolina for a rally where she sought to refocus her campaign on the plight of the working class  which has turned out to be a potent theme for trump leaving the stage to the tune of james browns i feel good clinton told reporters she kept her pneumonia diagnosis last friday quiet telling only senior staff because she thought she would be able to power through the illness and keep campaigning from my perspective i thought i was going to be fine and i thought that there was no reason to make a big fuss about it she said on sunday clinton nearly collapsed while leaving a ceremony marking the sept   attacks in new york her illness coincided with a minisurge by trump who has drawn even or taken a slight lead in national polls polls in battleground states where the race is likely to be decided showed trump now leading in iowa ohio florida and nevada and tied in north carolina following her appearance in north carolina clinton was scheduled to appear at a washington dinner clintons campaign chairman john podesta said the candidate and her aides expected the contest to be close we always expected the race to tighten up we still feel like were in a strong position with organizational advantage in florida and ohio podesta told reporters on thursday they call these states battlegrounds for a reason in a speech at the new york economic club trump stuck to his script avoiding the more improvisational style that has produced a cornucopia of controversies trump pushed a package of tax cuts he said would help power the us economy to an annual growth rate of  percent the new york businessman said his goal would be  percent growth a target originally championed by republican primary rival jeb bush trump said the growth would generate  million new jobs his economic package resurrected a decadesold debate on whether tax cuts can generate sustainable growth but the overarching impression left by his speech was one of trump talking about substantive issues and avoiding the frivolous bob shrum a democratic strategist who managed  candidate john kerrys unsuccessful campaign said clinton remained the favorite to win the white house with demographic changes favoring her over trump who is heavily reliant on white voters what has hurt clinton shrum said is not the time taken off from the campaign trail but rather her decision to keep her diagnosis secret until forced to disclose it  which reinforced a perception among voters that she has a penchant for secrecy fairly or unfairly what this was taken as was more evidence that she was not transparent and thats what hurts her shrum said she been far more transparent than trump but she hasnt gotten any credit for it democrats have sought to pressure trump to release his tax returns but the republican has said he will not release them until a federal government audit has been completed clinton has released her tax records with the candidates health in the spotlight trump  on thursday released details of a recent physical examination a day after clinton released specifics on her medical condition trumps campaign said the results of his physical showed the fastfood fan has normal cholesterol with the help of a statin drug weighs  pounds  kg and has normal blood pressure in a notsosubtle slap at clinton the trump campaign said his medical report showed he has the stamina to endure  uninterrupted  the rigors of a punishing and unprecedented presidential campaign and more importantly the singularly demanding job of president of the united states trump also appeared on the dr oz show to discuss his health in an interview with host mehmet oz a surgeon top clinton aide jennifer palmieri said one upside of clintons unplanned break was the chance to sharpen the final argument clinton will present to voters in these closing weeks our campaign readily admits that running against a candidate as controversial as donald trump means it is harder to be heard on what you aspire for the countrys future and it is incumbent on us to work harder palmieri said in a statement trump backers on capitol hill said they were heartened by the tightening race after a call on thursday morning with his campaign manager kellyanne conway who mapped out what the campaign was doing she promised a more policydriven approach from trump in the races final stretch the poll numbers are just looking phenomenal as you move away from registered voters to likely voters

6112,WHAT DO VOTERS SEE IN TRUMP HIS AUTHENTIC PHONINESS,"the chances of donald trump becoming the republican nominee for president have gone from impossible to probable while hillary clintons chances of being the democrat have moved from likely to virtually certain so barring more surprises its probably going to be hillary vs the donald in the fall

there is no mystery about clinton those who support her as well as those who oppose her have little trouble explaining why trump is another matter no one i know would even consider voting for trump so who are all these millions who support him why they are workingclass white men we are told who feel betrayed by the failure of both parties to deal with stagnant incomes growing debts and shrinking possibilities for their retirements and their childrens futures

its a plausible theory and it may help to explain bernie sanders but no one has ever associated trump with these bluecollar issues how has he become the tribune of the people in this election is he just the one who got there first

the explanation is not so difficult in the opening paragraph of his novel ravelstein saul bellow writes anyone who wants to govern the country has to entertain it clinton has been called many things but entertaining is not one of them this is not the case with trump who is an authentic american character like something out of mark twain all the other candidates except sanders had the character squeezed out of them when they decided they wanted to be president trumps a phony of course not to mention a racist but his phoniness is authentic hes selfmade  not in the financial sense but characterologically

and what a character you always want to know what he will say or do next to be sure its not really the presidents job to keep the citizenry entertained although voting on the basis of entertainment value is not entirely irrational given that entertainment is the main benefit youre likely to get from our political system anyway not knowing what hell do next does have its charms and they go beyond entertainment

during the nuclear standoff of the s and s richard nixon and henry kissinger took advantage of a doctrine out of the branch of economics known as game theory which holds that sometimes it pays to be  or at least to be perceived to be  crazy no rational person would ever start a nuclear war so the one who can get the other side to back down in any future nuclear standoff is the one who convinces the world that he or she is more irrational vladimir putin has done a pretty good job here you have to admit imagine putin and any of the american presidential candidates facing each other across the nuclear divide each threatening to push the button unless their demands are met which of the americans is crazy enough to actually do it

when barack obama proposes something you know its been analyzed and balanced and weighed against the alternatives tested in the laboratory and found to be a reasonable solution given the limitations and under the circumstances when trump faces some similar challenge you dont know what hes going to say or do and if he says hes going to do something crazy like get the mexicans to pay for a wall across their own country to keep themselves out of ours you cant be sure he wont actually try to do it

its clear now that the title of trumps book the art of the deal  actually reflects a philosophy of life trump believes that everything in life is a negotiation a deal and he believes that making deals uses skills that he has and his rivals lack this is why he may even have been sincere in his puzzlement about why the media has been so insistent that he reveal his tax returns paying taxes like so much else in life is a negotiation  at least at trumps level and why would you give your opponent a major document whether it reveals misbehavior or not what is misbehavior for that matter its all up for negotiation

6118,COMMENT ON QUID PRO QUO WIKILEAKS EMAIL REVEALS CLINTON CAMPAIGN EYEING PAUL RYANS RELATIVE FOR SUPREME COURT BY LENORELEE,"new wikileaks email dumps have revealed massive corruption surrounding hillary clinton campaign chair john podesta  in one email dated february   an article sent by hillary advisor sara solow to podesta and hillarys foreign policy advisor jake sullivan indicates that the clinton campaign is considering house speaker paul ryans relative for the supreme court  
ketanji brown is the subject of the article she is related to paul ryan by marriage and is a judge on the us district court for the district of columbia 
the email reads she was confirmed by without any republican opposition in the senate not once but twice she was confirmed to her current position in  by unanimous consent  that is without any stated opposition she was also previously confirmed unanimously to a seat on the us sentencing commission where she became vice chair 
her family is impressive she is married to a surgeon and has two young daughters her father is a retired lawyer and her mother a retired school principal her brother was a police officer in the unit that was the basis for the television show  the wire  and is now a law student and she is related by marriage to congressman and speaker of the house paul ryan 
earlier this month he even said he would not campaign for nor support his partys nominee donald trump  in fact some supporters of trump have theorized that ryan was somehow behind or involved in the leak of the tape in which trump made sexually crude comments about women 
if you claim this is merely circumstantial then i think there is no hope for you understanding just how corrupt dc has gotten and this is the very paul ryan i warned you about in  which everyone said was so conservative sadly many didnt listen and voted for liberal mitt romney and him perhaps paul ryans records and emails should be leaked and maybe we just might see that hes willing to engage hillary in a paytoplay scheme

6122, EMAILS FOUND ON ANTHONY WEINERS LAPTOP DOJ BLOCKED FOUNDATION PROBE,"
yesterday we reported that the fbi has found  tens of thousands of emails  belonging to huma adein on anthony weiners computer raising questions how practical it is that any conclusive finding will be available or made by the fbi in the few days left before the elections
now according to the wsj  it appears that federal agents are preparing to scour roughly  emails that as we reported moments ago were discovered weeks ago on the laptop of anthony weiner  to see how many relate to a prior probe of hillary clintons email use as metadata on the device suggests there may be thousands sent to or from the private server that the democratic nominee used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter
as the wsj adds the review will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are workrelated emails between huma abedin a close clinton aide and the estranged wife of mr weiner and state department officials how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of investigation and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the clinton email probe which fbi officials call midyear 
and as we further reported earlier today  the fbi has had to await a court order to begin reviewing the emails because they were uncovered in an unrelated probe of mr weiner and that order was delayed for reasons that remain unclear
more stunning is just how many emails were found on weiners computer and while one can only imagine the content of some of the more persona ones the wsj writes that the latest development began in early october when new yorkbased fbi officials notified andrew mccabe the bureaus secondincommand that while investigating mr weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a minor they had recovered a laptop with  emails many they said were from the accounts of ms abedin according to people familiar with the matter
those emails stretched back years these people said and were on a laptop that both mr weiner and ms abedin used and that hadnt previously come up in the clinton email probe ms abedin said in late august that the couple were separating
the fbi had searched the computer while looking for child pornography  people familiar with the matter said but the warrant they used didnt give them authority to search for matters related to mrs clintons email arrangement at the state department mr weiner has denied sending explicit or indecent messages to the teenager
as reported yesterday it appears that there are potentially tens of thousands of abedin linked emails on weiners computer
in their initial review of the laptop the metadata showed many messages apparently in the thousands that were either sent to or from the private email server at mrs clintons home that had been the focus of so much investigative effort for the fbi  senior fbi officials decided to let the weiner investigators proceed with a closer examination of the metadata on the computer and report back to them
the wsj then connects the dots between how the weiner emails were linked to the clinton reopening of the clinton probe despite loretta lynchs and the dojs vocal urges not to do so 
at a meeting early last week of senior justice department and fbi officials a member of the departments senior nationalsecurity staff asked for an update on the weiner laptop the people familiar with the matter said at that point officials realized that no one had acted to obtain a warrant these people said 
mr mccabe then instructed the email investigators to talk to the weiner investigators and see whether the laptops contents could be relevant to the clinton email probe these people said after the investigators spoke the agents agreed it was potentially relevant 
mr comey was given an update decided to go forward with the case and notified congress on friday with explosive results  senior justice department officials had warned mr comey that telling congress would violate wellestablished policies against overt actions that could affect an election and some within the fbi have been unhappy at mr comeys repeated public statements on the probe going back to his first press conference on the subject in july
but wait  it gets better
recall that this is the same andrew mcabe whose wife the wall street journal reported last week received  in campaign funds in late  from the political action committee of virginia gov terry mcauliffe a longtime ally of the clintons and until he was elected governor in november  a clinton foundation board member 
mr mcauliffe had supported dr mccabe in the hopes she and a handful of other democrats might help win a majority in the state senate giving mr mcauliffe more sway in the state capitol dr mccabe lost her race last november and democrats failed to win their majority
fbi officials have said mr mccabe had no role in the clinton email probe until he became deputy director and there was no conflict of interest because by then his wifes campaign was over
which brings us to the second big topic the clinton foundation and how the doj made sure that particular probe never made the light of day at the same time as the clinton server was being investigated other clintonrelated investigations were under way within the fbi and they have been the subject of internal debate for months
early this year four fbi field officesnew york los angeles washington and little rock arkwere collecting information about the clinton foundation to see if there was evidence of financial crimes or influencepeddling according to people familiar with the matter
the wsj touches on something fascinating los angeles agents had picked up information about the clinton foundation from an unrelated public corruption case and had issued some subpoenas for bank records related to the foundation these people said  so where did that trail go apparently nowhere
the washington field office was probing financial relationships involving mr mcauliffe before he became a clinton foundation board member these people said mr mcauliffe has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer has said the probe is focused on whether he failed to register as an agent of a foreign entitythe fbi field office in new york had done the most work on the clinton foundation case and received help from the fbi field office in little rock the people familiar with the matter said
in february fbi officials made a presentation to the justice department according to these people by all accounts the meeting didnt go well
some said that is because the fbi didnt present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the clinton foundation and that the career public integrity prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasnt a very strong case others said that from the start the justice department officials were stern icy and dismissive of the case 
that was one of the weirdest meetings ive ever been to one participant told others afterward according to people familiar with the matter
needless to say the probe into the foundation faded
but back to the clinton probe according to a person familiar with the probes on aug  a senior justice department official called mr mccabe to voice his displeasure at finding that new york fbi agents were still openly pursuing the clinton foundation probe despite the departments refusal to allow more aggressive investigative methods in the case mr mccabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didnt use those methods
at this point a question emerges did mccabe seek to defend or press on with a clinton probe
mr mccabes defenders in the agency said that following the call he repeated the instruction that he had given earlier in the clinton foundation investigation agents were to keep pursuing the work within the authority they had
others further down the fbi chain of command however said agents were given a much starker instruction on the case stand down when agents questioned why they werent allowed to take more aggressive steps they said they were told the order had come from the deputy directormr mccabe others familiar with the matter deny mr mccabe or any other senior fbi official gave such a standdown instruction
at this point the two probes into hillarys email and the clinton foundation converged
for agents who already felt uneasy about fbi leaderships handling of the clinton foundation case the moment only deepened their concerns these people said for those who felt the probe hadnt yet found significant evidence of criminal conduct the leaderships approach was the right response to the facts on the ground
things accelerated over the past two months when in september agents on the foundation case asked to see the emails contained on nongovernment laptops that had been searched as part of the clinton email case but that request was rejected by prosecutors at the eastern district of new york in brooklyn those emails were given to the fbi based on grants of partial immunity and limiteduse agreements meaning agents could only use them for the purpose of investigating possible mishandling of classified information
some fbi agents were dissatisfied with that answer and asked for permission to make a similar request to federal prosecutors in manhattan according to people familiar with the matter mr mccabe these people said told them no and added that they could not go prosecutorshopping
not long after that discussion fbi agents informed the bureaus leaders about the weiner laptop prompting mr comeys disclosure to congress and setting of the furor that promises to consume the final days of a tumultuous campaign
while much of the latest developments are known or could have been inferred assuming more corruption within government agencies the punchline is that the weeks if not months of upcoming work means that if clinton wins the white house she will likely do so amid at least one ongoing investigation into her inner circle being handled by lawenforcement officials who are deeply divided over how to manage such cases  it also means that trump will be hounding hillary for the remainder of the campaign as being the only presidential candidate to seek election with a recently reopened criminal probe hanging over her head delivered by the daily sheeple

6125,AFTER AUNG SAN SUU KYIS FIRST YEAR IN POWER DISMAY SWIRLS IN MYANMAR  THE NEW YORK TIMES,mawlamyine myanmar     the scene would have been unlikely a year ago tens of thousands of demonstrators filled the streets to protest a decision by daw aung san suu kyis government to name a new bridge for her father recognize the will of the local ethnic people protesters chanted last month as they marched along the waterfront of this historic city in southern myanmar ms aung san suu kyi a nobel peace prize laureate once celebrated as a champion of democracy was insulting the mon people the dominant ethnic group in the area protest leaders said by naming the bridge for a burmese leader infamous here for steamrollering over their rights this is not a democratic process said min zarni oo general secretary of the mon youth forum this is a big issue for the local people the government doesnt value ethnic diversity  no one expected governing to be easy for ms aung san suu kyi who became the countrys de facto leader a year ago after her party won a landslide election that ended more than a   of military rule even so her first year has been a disappointment to many she made it a top priority to end the   ethnic insurgencies that have torn the country apart but her anemic peace effort has proved fruitless so far and fighting between government forces and ethnic groups has increased the world has been shocked by reports that the military has carried out atrocities including rape and murder against the rohingya a muslim minority in western myanmar but ms aung san suu kyi has said little on the matter and done even less her governments growing suppression of speech on the internet seems perverse for a onetime democracy icon who spent  years under house arrest among the public patience is wearing thin she doesnt have support like before said zar zar oo  a vendor selling bottled water at the yangon train station we loved her so much before but it seems like she doesnt do enough for us for now we are in trouble  in a televised speech to the nation commemorating her first year in office ms aung san suu kyi struck a defensive note acknowledging her governments lack of progress and saying people could choose another leader if they were unhappy with her if you think i am not good enough for our country and our people if someone or some organization can do better than us we are ready to step down she said some voters apparently listened in parliamentary   last weekend her national league for democracy won only nine of  seats ms aung san suu kyi  cites building roads as one of her biggest accomplishments the party spokesman win htein said her government had doubled spending on health care and education though he provided no details and the economy has continued to grow as the country emerges from isolation under military rule but richard horsey a political analyst and former united nations official said that the growth had slowed and that foreign investment had dipped significantly washingtons lifting of economic sanctions last year has yet to translate into stronger trade investment or job creation he said aung san suu kyis administration has not offered any compelling economic vision he said in yangon people are waiting for ms aung san suu kyi to deliver results said myat suu mon  a department store clerk the cost of taking the   bus to work has doubled she said while her pay has remained the same support is less than before because peoples expectations were too high she said but in reality we dont see things changing here  zaw htay ms aung san suu kyis spokesman acknowledged that progress had been slow but said the government faced complex problems such as ethnic conflicts and clashes with the rohingya that had been years in the making its very complicated he said in an interview we are not magicians  indeed ms aung san suu kyi faces daunting challenges in rebuilding the country she must overcome decades of mismanagement and profiteering by previous military governments that enriched the generals and their cronies and brought the economy to its knees though her party has a strong majority in parliament it is hamstrung by a   arrangement dictated by the   constitution which gives the military control of key ministries and enough seats in parliament to block any constitutional amendment ms aung san suu kyi is barred by the constitution from serving as president because her children are foreigners a prohibition she circumvented by creating the office of state counselor for herself and declaring that the president would report to her she also named herself foreign minister supporters say her ability to get along with the military is a significant accomplishment but critics suggest she suffers from stockholm syndrome becoming too cozy with her former captors moreover they say her imperious approach alienates potential allies and contributes to the countrys growing crises shes mary poppins without a sense of humor said david scott mathieson an independent analyst she has a schoolmarmish way where instructions are given and obedience is observed she takes that approach with government and it is highly misplaced politics is compromise  she rarely takes questions from the news media or speaks out on major issues her office declined a request for an interview for this article perhaps most disheartening to many of her longtime supporters has been her record on human rights while she released dozens of political prisoners held by the former regime and repealed laws used to suppress political dissent she left in place a law that is increasingly used to stifle criticism of public officials under the telecommunications act defaming someone online is punishable by three years in prison anyone can bring a case and suspects can be held without bail while they await trial the previous government which adopted the law in  used it only seven times in the year since ms aung san suu kyi took office  cases have been brought according to maung saungkha who was once imprisoned under the law and now tracks its use in one case two media executives were jailed after posting comments on facebook questioning why a government official was wearing an expensive watch five cases have been brought by supporters of ms aung san suu kyi against people they claim defamed her mr maung said without freedom of expression there wont be democracy he said if the government wants national reconciliation this kind of law has to be discarded  mr win the party spokesman said parliament would amend the law in its next session dont worry about this he said we will solve this problem  the biggest stain on ms aung san suu kyis record may be her governments brutal treatment of the rohingya and her tepid response to it in recent months government soldiers have been accused of widespread killing and rape of rohingya in rakhine state a united nations report concluded in february that the army and police had slaughtered hundreds of men women and children   women and girls and forced as many as   people from their homes the deadly crackdown which the government says was a response to attacks on police posts by rohingya insurgents has been roundly criticized by human rights groups the united nations pope francis and even  of ms aung san suu kyis fellow nobel laureates who wrote a letter calling it a human tragedy amounting to ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity  although ms aung san suu kyi has no direct control over the military she has played down the reports of atrocities and stood by the military i dont think there is ethnic cleansing going on she said in a rare interview with the bbc last week i think ethnic cleansing is too strong an expression to use for what is happening  she did appoint a commission led by kofi annan the former united nations secretary general to examine conditions in rakhine but reviewing the militarys conduct was not part of its mandate entire villages were razed said matthew smith director of the group fortify rights children were thrown into fires suu kyis denials and failure to provide a shred of moral leadership to deal with the situation is a really damning revelation of her character  ms aung san suu kyi has said her most important goal is negotiating peace with armed ethnic groups and in august she convened a peace conference with great fanfare to resolve the conflicts in northern myanmar but the meeting produced no   agreements and analysts say there is more fighting now in that part of the country than there has been in many years the blowback over the   in mon state seen here as more evidence that the government is out of touch with the concerns of ethnic minorities should have been easier to avoid mr zaw ms aung san suu kyis spokesman said senior party leaders had been warned that naming the bridge for her father gen aung san would turn the population against them they went ahead anyway and last weekend it cost them the parliamentary seat in chaungzon the township across the bridge from mawlamyine it was a mistake to name this bridge mr zaw said it is a good lesson for n l d leaders

6129,TRUMPS CORPORATE TARGETS FACE TRICKY TASK IN FENDING OFF HIS ATTACKS,reuters  as the white house race took off last summer food giant mondelez international found itself in an unusual position republican candidate donald trump began delivering broadsides against one of its iconic products oreo cookies nabisco is closing a factory in chicago and theyre moving to mexico no more oreos i dont like oreos anymore trump told a crowd in new hampshire on aug  reacting to reports that mondelez was shutting down some production lines at its nabisco subsidiary in chicago while boosting output in mexico trumps statement that mondelez was closing a chicago factory was erroneous as the company quickly pointed out but that didnt stop him from repeating it its unusual for a top presidential candidate especially a representative of the businessfriendly republican party to attack major us corporations by name  but over the course of his unconventional campaign trump has aimed his fire at a range of companies mostly for shifting jobs abroad ford motor co united technologies corp unit carrier corp but also for building products in foreign markets apple and for what he said were violations of antitrust laws amazon  trump has threatened the companies with boycotts tariffs taxes and other punishments the trump campaign declined to comment for this story  some of the companies saw their share prices dip in the wake of trumps criticism while others experienced a small boost but all of them were presented with a dilemma thats familiar to the presumptive nominees many vanquished republican rivals should they engage with a possible future president known for holding a grudge possibly inviting more wrath or should they lie low and risk allowing trump to define them and to push policies they deem harmful most have sought to stay out of the fray even as trump has kept up the drumbeat of criticism i am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the united states many companies  like ford general motors nabisco carrier  are moving production to mexico trump said this week this was bad for all americans he said    it was the first time trump included gm in his roster of corporate wrongdoers though the trump campaign later removed gm from the statement and declined to say why gm declined comment      mondelez previously known as kraft foods took a different tack after trump vowed to boycott oreos mondelez fielded numerous media inquiries and contacted reporters when the company deemed press coverage of his remarks off base said laurie guzzinati who oversees governmental affairs in north america for mondelez the company didnt engage in any trumpbashing though guzzinati said trumps comments were grounded in inaccuracies  she said she told reporters that mondelez would continue to make oreos in three locations in the united states countering the impression trump may have left that oreos would no longer be made in the united states mondelezs response tracks closely what crisis management experts recommend for trumptargeted companies   hilary rosen a managing director for washington dc communications firm skd knickerbocker said her firm was representing corporate clients who have been singled out by trump though she declined to name them  rosens advice to clients she said is dont depend on educating donald trump on the truth people have tried and failed rosen a democrat recommends instead that companies make their case to the journalists who cover trump so donald trump does not define you none of the companies targeted by trump acknowledged hiring outside consultants to deal with his criticism many declined to comment for this story  youre not going to win in a oneonone confrontation with donald trump youre just going to get mired in the mud said juda engelmayer senior vice president for crisis management at w public relations in new york  those who have been willing to engage including ford chairman bill ford have avoided getting too personal trump has railed against ford for manufacturing vehicles in mexico threatening a tariff of up to  percent on every car bumper and part entering the united states from mexico  ford the greatgrandson of the automakers founder henry ford called trumps critique distorted and said the company instead should be held up as a real success story  we didnt take the government bailout during the  recession ford told reporters at a conference in detroit on may  contrasting his company with gm and chrysler we paid back our debts we pulled ourselves up by our boot straps we are investing in america  crisis management experts said companies targeted by trump need to be thinking more about the policy implications of his presidency that means for example shoring up support in the us congress for the north american free trade agreement nafta which trump has said he wants to renegotiate    a trade lobbyist who asked not to be named because he has worked with one of the companies trump has called out said trumps attacks do not particularly hurt companies reputations in washington because policymakers understand presidential campaigns are the political silly season but he said they can impact broader efforts on trade and other policies i think what this suggests he said is that there needs to be a concentrated effort by the business community to talk about the benefits of trade

6137,RISING PRICES IN OAKLAND PUSH ARTISTS INTO RISKY HOUSING  THE NEW YORK TIMES,oakland calif     san francisco is full of big dreams oakland is where people make them work the city of about   sits on the east side of san francisco bay and historically has served as a   alternative to its more famous neighbor a place where service workers could buy a home young professionals could get an extra bedroom and artists lived in   warehouses while sleeping beside their next installation but over the past few years as prices have surged across the bay area oaklands pricing advantages have mostly eroded rents have increased  percent in five years more than in any other big city in the nation according to zillow the online real estate pricing service the citys   median rent is now among the highest and just short of median rents in manhattan the conditions that led to the fire that killed at least  people on friday night was a result of a dangerous mix of factors in which dozens of partygoers were invited to a warehouse that was dark congested and mazelike with flammable art and a   electrical system the victims died because they were trapped in a tinderbox yet the economic backdrop of the tragedy is also important because it shows how rising rents and fears of eviction can push vulnerable people in a desperate search for housing to unsafe spaces oaklands housing prices have always fluctuated with bay area booms and busts and complaints about gentrification were part of the s   boom here as well the effects are more pronounced this time around because as tech companies have migrated closer to san francisco from places like palo alto and mountain view oakland has been pulled deeper into silicon valleys orbit uber the   service now valued at almost  billion plans to open an office in downtown oakland in the next year or so this crisis isnt limited to the bay area across the country and especially in expensive cities like new york and seattle urban areas have been flooded with   tech and finance workers who have pushed up rents   workers and families have been displaced to cheaper housing on the fringe but many creative types have made do by finding alternative living arrangements like industrial property recreational vehicles and even boats in oakland where for decades warehouses have served as a haven for artists this often means living at the whims of any landlord willing to look the other way theres a kind of unholy alliance in which these buildings are leased with a nod nod wink wink nobody lives there  said thomas dolan an oakland architect who specializes in   spaces and helps building owners convert illegally occupied warehouses into legally occupied lofts its a precarious situation where tenants exchange cheap rent for substandard housing     and if they rock the boat theyre out  in the aftermath of the fire artists grief over lost friends quickly turned to anxiety that a crackdown could lead to widespread eviction from one of the bay areas few remaining sources of affordable housing the   fear is does this mean the end of these spaces in the bay area and with it the last vestige of any kind of affordable artists community  said aaron muszalski an artist who has spent the past two decades living and working in warehouses across the region unlike san francisco whose   waterfront has been transformed into a   neighborhood where the san francisco giants play next to   condominiums oakland can still lay claim to the bay areas industrial past there are bars still frequented by dockworkers and hipsters wear   emblazoned with the hulking white cranes that line the port of oakland many of the citys industrial warehouses originally served as a waypoint where shippers stored cargo but as international commerce was accelerated by containerization     the process by which rectangular crates full of products like california wine and chinese electronics can be loaded by cranes between boats and trucks     warehouses went empty and artists moved in the result has been a vast gray economy of   spaces that legal or not are regarded as an important source of affordable housing and part of what makes oakland oakland there have been efforts to legalize oaklands   spaces for years said joshua simon executive director the east bay asian local development corporation a nonprofit that helps develop affordable housing today its critical that we find ways to use every housing option thats safe     the worst thing we could do would be to overreact and eliminate this type of housing as an option  the catch however is that once a loft becomes legal the rent becomes unaffordable so while living in an illegal space may require things like coping with a makeshift kitchen with a sink that drains into a bucket its better than living nowhere you bring these places up to code and you end up pricing out the people who make oakland such a great place mr dolan said cheap rent is not the only draw several current and former warehouse residents described being absorbed into a broad community centered on building and making noise whether its daytime hammering and welding or throbbing nighttime parties whose locations are secret part of the bonding experience is in maintaining the charade that nobody lives there there are rituals like renting   trucks to store mattresses on days when the building owner sends an insurance inspector over if the fire department knocks you ignore it before he became the owner of the starline social club an oakland bar and music space adam hatch  was part of an illegal   art gallery called lobot he remains connected with the scene and on monday night his bar was full of as hats raiders jackets and tears as patrons observed a moment of silence for a victim who painted nails there on monday nights sometimes its just sort of magical to be in a place youre not supposed to be mr hatch said of the warehouse scene but there is also a risk as the fire at the warehouse known as the ghost ship showed most of the power accrues to the   master tenant     the person whose name is on the lease the people who lived at ghost ship in the months

6144,FDA FOUND MANIPULATING THE MEDIA IN FAVOR OF BIG PHARMA,"home  health  media  fda found manipulating the media in favor of big pharma fda found manipulating the media in favor of big pharma  shares 
 although the federal drug administration is thought to serve american consumers by keeping them safe and wellinformed they are doing just the opposite by controlling the media and science press in order to create misleading and onesided articles 
an investigation into documents released through the freedom of information act by scientific american revealed that the fda uses a variety of tactics to prevent the full truth from being revealed about a certain product the biggest tactic is the closehold embargo where they invite a select few news sites to a briefing about the tobe released information with conditions they stipulate that the journalists have to surrender their reportorial independence by agreeing to only speak with sources approved by their agency 
when npr reporter rob stein was extended one of these loaded invitations he responded by saying my editors are uncomfortable with the condition that we cannot seek reaction and asked that they be given a bit more wiggle room to speak with others when stein was met with a resounding no he decided to agree to the terms and attend the briefing 
stein wasnt the only reporter to attend this particular briefing as other sites such as the wall street journal the washington post and the new york times were all present despite agreeing to the terms not everyone is actually comfortable with these conditions the new york times former public editor margaret sullivan said 
i think embargoes that attempt to control sourcing are dangerous because they limit the role of the reporter whose job is to do a full look at a subject its really inappropriate for a source to be telling a journalist whom he or she can and cant talk to 
other tactics used by the fda include denying major media outlets any access to the briefing prior to the public release of information and the deliverance of halftruths when asked questions directly to hinder an investigation those who intend to speak with unapproved sources or announce these embargoes are met with threats post navigation",1,362,1812,29/1/2019,Al Jazeera

martland martland is the brave man a soldier who saved the life of an afghan boy who was abducted held and abused as a sex slave by an afghan police chief abdul rahman the vicious powerful and arrogant coward the incomprehensible harm to martland resides in the inexplicable action taken by the us army the army disciplined martland relieved him from his duty post in afghanistan and is now seeking to involuntarily discharge him from military servicewhat was the dreadful and dischargeable infraction by the highly decorated green beret charles martland quinn was relieved of his special forces command after a fight with a usbacked militia leader who had a boy as a sex slave chained to his bed credit kirsten luce for nytin  martland and his special forces captain dan quinn who has since resigned from the military physically assaulted abdul rahman after learning that rahman had abducted a boy chained him to a bed repeatedly abused him as a sex slave and beat up the boy s mother when she sought to find and rescue her son the green berets intervened when they discovered that the boy was being raped and held as a sex slave according to the martland and quinn the afghan villagers were pleading with them to do something about repeated sexual assaults against children by the afghan policehere is the dirty not so little secret of afghanistan the sexual abuse of children is widespread and embedded into the afghan pashtun culture there is scant prosecution of child sex exploitation in afghanistan american military have long been saddled with the knowledge of the afghan practice of  bacha bazi  translated as dancing boys bacha bazi is the ancient and widespread practice of afghan men who abduct and lure poor boys into the grisly world of child sex slavery where they

old girl and the honor killing of an afghan commander s  year old daughter who kissed a boy martland who was fed up with the ongoing sexual exploitation of children by afghan officials said  i felt that morally we could no longer stand by and allow our afghan commanders to commit these atrocities since when is a highly decorated green beret who confronts a violent child sex predator and trafficker and woman beater punished and involuntarily discharge from the militarywhat happened to the greatest military and force for moral good on the face of the planet isn t martland carrying out the very anti human trafficking policies promulgated by the obama administrationobama s administration including his pentagon endlessly promotes and spends millions on sexual assault and human

toleranceus department of defense policy against human trafficking in the press release praising the ongoing military awareness training of human trafficking the army media alert highlights the annual training and progress for dod s military as  driving home the department s  zero tolerance  for slavery and human trafficking apparently that dod zero tolerance policy doesn t apply to captain quinn and sgt martland is it simply awareness but no action to stop human trafficking and sex slavery zero tolerance means stopping the cultural and systemic abduction and sex slavery of young afghan boys is the dod training report mere lip service and media hype to convince americans that the us military fights human trafficking and sex slaverythe dod press release ends with the ironic caveat that  military leadership also plays a critical awareness role in preventing such crimes  sgt martland and captain dan quinn are military leaders who  prevented  further human trafficking crimes and are now

6152,LEBANON EMERGES FROM CRISIS WITH IRAN ON TOP BUT RISKS REMAIN,beirut reuters  iran s allies in lebanon have emerged even stronger from a crisis triggered by saudi arabia which achieved little more than to force the saudis  main lebanese ally  prime minister saad alhariri  closer to tehran s friends in beirut    saudi arabia aimed to hurt iran in lebanon by forcing hariri s resignation on nov  and torpedoing his coalition deal with the iranianbacked hezbollah and its allies using its influence over the sunni leader to cause trouble for the shi ite group instead the move backfired as western states censured riyadh over a step they feared would destabilize lebanon despite their shared concerns over the regional role of the heavily armed hezbollah hariri revoked his resignation on tuesday drawing a line under the crisis caused by his announcement from riyadh lebanese officials say he was put under house arrest before french intervention led to his return home riyadh and hariri deny this but while the crisis has abated its causes  hezbollah s growing military influence in the region and saudi arabia s determination to counter iran  seem likely to bring more trouble lebanon s way sooner or later hariri has identified possible gulf arab sanctions as a major risk to the lebanese economy analysts also see a risk of another war with hezbollah s old foe israel which is alarmed by the group s strength in lebanon and syria the episode also leaves big questions over lebanese politics long influenced by saudi arabia a patron of the lebanese sunni community one senior lebanese politician said the experience had  left a big scar  on hariri once the  the spiritual son of saudi arabia   after this it will not be easy to have a normal relationship again  meeting on tuesday for the first time since the resignation hariri s government indirectly acknowledged saudi concerns over hezbollah s role outside lebanon at hariri s behest it reaffirmed its policy of staying out of arab conflicts a top lebanese official said western pressure forced saudi arabia to retreat from its lebanon plan but further saudi moves could not be ruled out  can we restrain saudi from going toward madness in my view no  a western diplomat said saudi measures targeting the lebanese economy were  a genuine possibility  at some point though the international community would likely try to influence how tough any sanctions would be   i think the saudis have understood from the international reaction that lebanon isn t a pitch on which they are playing alone there are other players who have interests who don t want to see those undermined  the diplomat said  at the same time the international community s patience isn t unlimited it will be hard to protect lebanon indefinitely if there is no tangible progress on rolling back hezbollah  hezbollah was the only group allowed to keep its weapons at the end of lebanon s  civil war to fight israeli forces occupying southern lebanon its militia has been a source of controversy in lebanon since the israeli withdrawal of  with saudi backing hariri led a lebanese political alliance to confront the group but that resulted in hezbollah s takeover of beirut in  during a brief civil war hezbollah s stature has grown in the chaos that swept the arab world after  it has backed president bashar alassad in syria and helped in the war against islamic state in iraq     but its role in the yemen conflict is seen as the main factor behind the crisis in lebanon saudi arabia accuses iran and hezbollah of military support for the iranianallied houthis in their war with a saudiled coalition hariri has repeatedly flagged yemen as the cause of the latest crisis and warned that lebanon s economy is at stake the economy depends on remittances from expat workers particularly in the gulf any threat to inflows is seen as a risk to the system that finances the heavily indebted state hezbollah leader sayyed hassan nasrallah has appeared to recalibrate his rhetoric in response to the crisis last month he denied his group was fighting in yemen or sending weapons to the houthis or firing rockets at saudi arabia from yemeni territory he also indicated hezbollah could pull its fighters from iraq the remarks on the eve of hariri s return were seen as  appeasing  a source close to hariri said hariri has twice led coalition governments including hezbollah despite his enmity toward the group five hezbollah members have been charged by a unbacked tribunal with the  assassination of his father rafik alhariri hezbollah denies any involvement hariri s willingness to compromise with hezbollah was a factor behind the saudi move against him and has drawn criticism from within the sunni community his status as lebanon s most influential sunni will be put to the test in parliamentary elections next year ashraf rifi a hawkish sunni politician said the way hariri reversed his resignation was a  farce  and a  surrender to the hezbollah project  the senior politician who spoke on condition of anonymity said hezbollah may offer hariri a  gesture  over its regional role but saw little prospect of the group fundamentally changing course president michel aoun a political ally of hezbollah could pressure the group  a little bit to be cooler on certain issues  the politician said but lebanese in saudi arabia still had reason to be afraid for their livelihoods  i think with time the lebanese will try to disentangle themselves from saudi arabia but this will cost lebanon a lot because revenues will be reduced  the hariri crisis marked an unprecedented intervention in lebanon even in a country with a long history of foreign meddling it also underlined the different priorities of saudi arabia and its western allies in lebanon  a major recipient of aid to help it host  million syrian refugees on the last day of hariri s stay in saudi arabia saudi crown prince mohammad bin salman summoned him for a meeting and kept him waiting for hours delaying his departure for france where president emanuel macron was waiting for him the senior politician and a top lebanese official said  macron was calling saad to find out where he was  said the senior politician adding that macron then called crown prince mohammad to tell him he was expecting hariri for lunch western states want stability in

6155,DEMOCRATS WITH GARLAND ON MIND MOBILIZE FOR SUPREME COURT FIGHT  THE NEW YORK TIMES,washington     senate democrats have one particular judges name in mind as they await the identity of president trumps supreme court nominee merrick b garland democrats and their allies remain furious that senate republicans refused to even consider judge garland president barack obamas nominee to the high court with  months remaining in mr obamas second term that deep resentment is certain to color their handling of mr trumps choice just as it has contributed to their resistance to moving quickly on mr trumps cabinet selections all indications are that they see the forthcoming nomination as a chance to take a strong stand against the new president since they still have the power to filibuster a supreme court choice     at least for now i havent seen the names said senator patrick j leahy democrat of vermont and a veteran of multiple supreme court fights but when they had a consensus person with merrick garland every single republican who raised their hand and solemnly swore before god to uphold the constitution refused to follow the constitution and even have a hearing  top democrats say they dont intend to play tit for tat with the nomination but they say they will insist on what they consider to be a mainstream candidate capable of securing at least the  votes needed to thwart any filibuster otherwise they promise to do whatever they can to block the nominee we are not going to do what the republicans did said senator chuck schumer of new york the democratic leader but if the candidates out of the mainstream i can tell you i will fight and my caucus will fight tooth and nail against them  the chief reason that democrats will not do what the republicans did is that they cant     republicans remain in the senate majority which last year enabled them to refuse to even schedule a hearing and now gives them control over the confirmation process but unlike with cabinet nominees democrats could still employ a filibuster against a supreme court pick because the high court was excluded from a  change engineered by democrats to thwart filibusters against   nominees if democrats hold out senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the majority leader will no doubt come under pressure to wipe out the possibility of filibuster against supreme court nominees given the steps republicans were willing to take to hold open the vacancy created by the death of antonin scalia democrats believe senate republicans might choose to eliminate that filibuster power too all the signals are there is no limit to what they are capable of doing to give the big special interests behind them control of the court said senator sheldon whitehouse of rhode island a democratic member of the judiciary committee but republicans are already differentiating their handling of mr garlands nomination from whatever is to come with the announcement by mr trump they argue that the situations are not comparable given the timing of the presidential election theres a big difference between not approving a supreme court nominee in the middle of a highly contested presidential election and the beginning of a   term mr mcconnell said on tuesday noting that republicans did not filibuster supreme court nominees in the first term of either president bill clinton or mr obama mr mcconnell took pains on tuesday to note that both republicans and democrats were invited to the white house to discuss the coming nomination with mr trump as part of the requirement for seeking the senates advice and consent many republicans and their conservative allies would prefer not to abolish the filibuster on supreme court nominees knowing that it could come back to haunt them by allowing a future democratic majority a free hand     essentially the same reason democrats left high court nominees out of the  change it is also unclear whether republicans would even have the votes to do so through a simple majority vote on an arcane procedural maneuver but the question will hang over the entire confirmation fight and could force a showdown if the democrats filibuster  then i guess well see what steps need to be taken at the time said senator john thune of south dakota a member of the republican leadership but i think the one thing that were committed to is getting a supreme court justice confirmed  democrats say that one result of the stalemate over judge garland is that it has shown that the supreme court can function though imperfectly without a full complement of nine members relieving the party of some guilt for keeping the court   if it comes to that over a trump nominee senator richard blumenthal a connecticut democrat who sits on the judiciary committee said democrats were also galvanized by the turnout at last weekends protests he said it would serve as a unifying force for senate democrats that swell of people and strength and spirit at the marches we had saturday showed us we have the american populace on our side mr blumenthal said they understand the importance of the supreme court to those issues that brought them to the streets principally women  mr blumenthal said the selection of a nominee by president trump would put a face and a voice on the supreme court battle but for now the face and voice most democrats are putting on the coming clash are those belonging to judge garland,0,893,4382,26/11/2019,TikTok
6156,TRUMP SAYS HE TRUSTS PUTINS DENIALS OF ELECTION MEDDLING,danang vietnam reuters  president donald trump said he believed president vladimir putin when he denied accusations that russia meddled in last year s us election despite us intelligence agencies  conclusion of russian interference trump made the comment after he and putin met briefly at a summit in vietnam on saturday and agreed on a joint statement supporting a political solution for syria now in its seventh year of civil war it was the first encounter of the two leaders since july and came during a low in usrussia relations and at a time when trump is haunted by an investigation into accusations that putin influenced the election that brought him to the white house putin reiterated the denials of interference trump said  every time he sees me he says  i didn t do that  and i really believe that when he tells me that he means it  trump told reporters aboard air force one after leaving the asiapacific economic cooperation apec summit in the resort of danang  i think he is very insulted by it which is not a good thing for our country  trump said trump has called allegations of campaign collusion with moscow a hoax a special counsel robert mueller is conducting a probe that has led to charges against trump s former campaign manager paul manafort and his associate rick gates us intelligence agencies have also concluded russians interfered to tip the election in trump s favor through hacking and releasing emails to embarrass democratic candidate hillary clinton and spreading social media propaganda on saturday james clapper the former director of national intelligence said trump has been informed of the conclusions showing russia s meddling  president trump was presented with clear and indisputable evidence that russia interfered in the election  clapper told reuters clapper was the national intelligence director when his office in january released the conclusion reached by the cia federal bureau of investigation and national security agency that russia had meddled in the  us presidential election told reuters  the fact that the president would take putin at his word over that of the intelligence community is quite simply unconscionable  clapper said russia has repeatedly denied meddling the republican chairman of the senate armed services committee john mccain took trump to task over his comments about putin using the  america first  phrase that trump invoked at the apec summit in laying out his trade priorities  there s nothing  america first  about taking the word of a kgb colonel over that of the american intelligence community  mccain said in a statement putin is a former kgb officer and exhead of russia s fsb security service adam schiff the top democrat on the us house of representatives intelligence committee which is investigating the issue accused trump of siding with putin over us intelligence agencies  the president fools no one he understands that the russians intervened through the hacking and dumping of his opponent s emails the fruits of which he exploited time and again on the campaign trail  schiff said in a statement in danang putin told reporters that an alleged link between manafort and russia was fabricated by trump s opponents putin dismissed suggestions russia influenced the elections through political advertising tech companies including facebook have said some russianbought political content spread on their platforms around the time  there is no confirmation of our mass media meddling in election campaigns   and there can t be any  putin said trump who had emphasized on the  campaign trail that it would be nice if the united states and russia could work together made this case again on saturday he said it would benefit washington to have good ties with moscow so they could work together on issues including syria s civil war the conflict in ukraine and the north korean nuclear crisis  look i can t stand there and argue with him i would rather have him get out of syria  trump said  i would rather  get to work with him on the ukraine rather than standing and arguing  in vietnam trump and putin agreed a joint statement that said there was no military solution to the syrian conflict pledged to continue  deconfliction  to ensure the us and russian militaries do not clash there and pledged new support for the unbacked  geneva process  which has failed to find a political solution to end the conflict russia has militarily supported syrian president bashar alassad while the united states has at times backed syrian rebels against him though the recent us focus has been on defeating the islamic state militant group that had seized parts of syria with islamic state having suffered losses in syria iraq and beyond greater attention is turning to the broader conflict between assad s forces and rebel factions trump hailed the joint statement  we did it very quickly  he told reporters  we seem to have a very good feeling for each other a good relationship considering we don t know each other well  after their meeting putin described trump as  a wellmannered person and comfortable to deal with  trump and putin were seen chatting amicably as they walked to the position where the traditional apec summit photo was being taken at a viewpoint looking over the south china sea ,0,873,4360,9/4/2024,The

6157,NO GOVERNMENT CANNOT RESTRICT FIRST AMENDMENT RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY IN SUPREME COURT PLAZA,"email 
rebutting the justice departments assertion that the government can dictate where people can engage in religious activity attorneys for the rutherford institute have asked the us district court for the district of columbia to reject the governments motion to dismiss the lawsuit challenging the supreme courts prohibition on first amendment activities on its own front porch 
the lawsuit paydentravers v talkin  contends that the governments restrictions on expressive activity in the plaza fronting the us supreme court violate the religious freedom restoration act the supreme court issued the ban on expressive activity in response to a june  ruling in another lawsuit hodge v talkin  also filed by rutherford institute attorneys challenging a yearold statute banning expressive activities on the supreme court plaza the federal district court declared the yearold statute to be unreasonable substantially overbroad and irreconcilable with the first amendment in may  the supreme court upheld its own ban on expressive activity in hodge  
in challenging the courts prohibitions on expressive activity as they relate to religious expression rutherford institute attorneys argue the plaza prohibition violates the religious freedom restoration act which says the government must have a compelling interest in order to intrude on someones religious liberty and it must do so in the least restrictive way affiliate attorney jeffrey light is assisting the rutherford institute with the first amendment lawsuit 
there are a good many things that are repugnant to the constitution right now mass surveillance of americans roadside strip searches forcible dna extractions swat team raids civil commitments for criticizing the government etc said constitutional attorney john w whitehead president of the rutherford institute and author of battlefield america the war on the american people  however for the us supreme court to overtly prohibit expressive activity on its grounds shows exactly how perverse our socalled system of justice has become 
the plaza area in front of the supreme court is oval in shape and approximately  feet in length is open hours a day and is no different than other traditional public fora such as parks and sidewalks the plaza has historically been used for first amendment activities including press conferences tourists conversations and filming of scenes for movies nevertheless a yearold statute broadly made it unlawful to display any flag banner or device designed to bring into public notice a party organization or movement while on the grounds of the us supreme court thereby banning expressive activity on the supreme court plaza 
in january  the rutherford institute filed a lawsuit hodge v talkin  on behalf of a political activist who was charged with violating the statute by silently standing on the plaza with a sign protesting police brutality in june  us district court judge beryl l howell ruled that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad facially unconstitutional and void just two days after this ruling the supreme court adopted regulation  which attempts to reinstate the restrictions struck down by judge howell by banning any demonstration on the supreme court grounds which is broadly defined by regulation  to include all forms of conduct communicating views or grievances that might draw onlookers

6158,FEMINIST CAMILLE PAGLIA SLAMS CLINTON,"email 
there is very little truth in politics today we all for different reasons pull for a letter or party rather than for character and ability we will spin for our candidate because of the party we root for so that others will blindly follow the party line 
if my guys are running the country we think then things will be better even though these guys support and do things that are contrary to our definition of better so when a person comes out and speaks truth about their candidate it can be refreshing 
this is why i am so excited by what i read recently 
the washington times reports  
lesbian feminist author and professor camille paglia has delivered a scathing rebuke of hillary clinton  saying the sole reason for the democratic presidential nominees success is because she is a woman 
its an outrage how shes played the gender card ms paglia told the spectator magazine in an interview published friday she is a woman without accomplishment i sponsored or cosponsored  bills oh really these were bills to rename bridges and so forth and the things she has accomplished have been like the destabilization of north africa causing refugees to flood into italy  the woman is a disaster 
paglia is wellknown for her attacks on modern feminism and she has boldly stated the truth about this antifeminist woman hillary clinton  hillary is a woman who is only wellknown because of her womanizing sexoffending husband 
as i have shown before there actually may be a shift in power as those the democrats have used to gain said power are finally noticing that they are receiving almost nothing in return for their vote 
paglia says as much 
the times continue 
if hillary wins nothing will change she continued she knows the bureaucracy all the offices of government and thats what she likes to do sit behind the scenes and manipulate the levers of power but people want change and theyre sick of the establishment 
she even went as far as giving a point to trump 
ms paglia said its very unlikely that a donald trump presidency would threaten western civilization as so many pundits and politicians have predicted 
things they are changing

6161,FIORINA WINS WHEN SHE STUMPS TRUMP,"cnn cnn opinion asked a range of contributors for their take on the cnn debate of republican presidential candidates who were the winners and losers the opinions expressed in these commentaries are theirs

the republican race for president just got a lot more serious

at the second republican presidential debate there was minimal namecalling and personal insults by donald trump and all of the candidates not named donald trump rushed into the void taking advantage of an opportunity to make a good impression  succeeding more often than not

the clearest winner of the debate was carly fiorina who successfully challenged trump  criticizing his wisecracks about her personal appearance and challenging his credentials as a global businessman by deftly ticking off hotspots around the world and suggesting ways she would tackle them

but other candidates took turns at laying out specific plans and contrasting their ideas with those of their rivals sen rand paul a libertarian took issue with jeb bushs vow to crack down on recreational marijuana and chris christie jumped into the conversation to warn about the dangers of marijuana use leading to abuse of harder drugs  a point underscored by fiorina who talked about the death of her stepdaughter who was a drug user

the big news in all of this was that the field of candidates werent dancing to trumps tune instead they talked in a serious way about serious issues and for considerable swaths of the debate it was possible to forget trump was onstage at all marco rubio and christie went back and forth on climate change and ted cruz debated bush over the process and criteria for naming supreme court justices ben carson argued for a twotier minimum wage

it remains true that a large percentage of the republican voting base is disgusted by politicians and convinced that a brash straighttalker like trump might fix this but the debate served as a reminder that trumps  support also means that  of republican voters are looking for a different candidate to support the debate proved they have plenty of viable choices

to be taken half as seriously as a man goes an old adage a woman must be twice as good her male rivals ought to be taking carly fiorina a lot more seriously than that today because she was better  a lot better  than most of them in the cnn debate

she came prepared with crisp coherent responses to nearly every issue raised and delivered two of the best monologues of the night  one when she spoke movingly about burying a child lost to drug addiction the other about empowering every woman to realize her aspirations she also put down donald trump on his slur about her face he lamely praised her looks when instead he should have apologized

trump seemed tight at the start needlessly picking fights but he got his bearings halfway through and finished upbeat i doubt he will pay much of a price for his early bombast but he may well see fiorina more than ben carson soon nipping at his heels

a debate that seemed long did have one major virtue it allowed other candidates far more openings to distinguish themselves marco rubio and chris christie took the most advantage both were much more effective than in the first debate the race itself like the debate is likely to seesaw back and forth for many weeks to come

david gergen is a senior political analyst for cnn and has been a white house adviser to four presidents a graduate of harvard law school he is a professor of public service and codirector of the center for public leadership at the harvard kennedy school

carly fiorina won on style and substance unlike marco rubio who dominated the few times he spoke fiorina made sure she had more than a few bites at the mic unlike jeb bush who could only politely respond to donald trumps insults while still losing most of the exchanges fiorina proved to be the only candidate who could effectively push back on trump and his substancefree assertions

her perfectly calibrated and classy response to his insult of her face was an instant classic destined to dominate debate highlight reels now trump is calling carly fiorina a wonderful person and beautiful thats the trumpenglish definition for apology  thats fiorinaenglish for a win

fiorina handled the attacks on her business record deftly and then attacked trumps habit of hanging creditors out to dry in the wake of his bankruptcies for a gop generally in trouble with women shes the only candidate that could get away with calling the move to change the face on the  bill a pander and shes right we should know our history and make new history  today  by considering carly fiorina the breakout top tier candidate of round 

margaret hoover is the president of the rightleaning advocacy group american unity fund and author of american individualism how a new generation of conservatives can save the republican party she is the host of siriusxms get it right with margaret hoover

trump came out swinging  but ended up missing not only wasnt he substantive  again  but he made some pretty bizarre statements he thinks a flat tax is more complicated than a regressive tax he said that vaccines cause autism he wants syria and isis to fight each other he will get along with putin this stuff doesnt hold up to scrutiny the question is whether any is ever applied to trump

ben carson also suffered some serious stumbles that will likely hurt him namely the bizarre suggestion that a bully pulpit would have been a better response to  than fighting terrorists saying that americans arent willing to perform agriculture jobs that our air force isnt capable and our marines arent ready is pretty irresponsible stuff

i think carly fiorina on the other hand managed to beat already high expectations she was sharp quick on her feet and delivered more than one great applause line particularly effective was her emotional plea to defund planned parenthood and she used every opportunity to get as granular and specific on policy as she could i expect her poll numbers to rise

se cupp is the author of losing our religion the liberal medias attack on christianity coauthor of why youre wrong about the right and a columnist at the new york daily news

no big themes no clear sense of vision emerged from the three hours of jawing in tonights debate such are the downsides i suppose of putting  candidates on a stage and divvying up minute slots for each candidate to make a mark

so we saw flashes of christie the populist fiorina the trump slayer kasich the sunny multilateralist trump the bombast rand the constitutionalist carson the logician but their claims didnt add up to much that was especially comprehensible certainly not memorable

to be sure there were moments  the best perhaps being fiorina telling trump that women across america know exactly what he meant when he insulted her looks rubio gave another strong performance though it remains unclear whether he can capitalize on these performances on the campaign trail huckabee and walker by contrast couldnt seem to nudge the conversation much at all

my wish for the next debate on october  we narrow down the list dig a little deeper and force the candidates to say something serious about the confluence of urban challenges associated with class race and drug enforcement that just now only rand paul seems willing to discuss

biggest winner george w bush long forgotten who was invoked as the man who kept america safe  a claim that received the loudest applause of the night

biggest disappointment once again no serious or sustained discussion of issues involving race poverty and violence in american cities these were barely recognized last go around they werent so much as mentioned tonight

william howell is the sydney stein professor in american politics at the university of chicago

carly fiorina was the big winner tonight she is the only candidate to date to take on trump and come out a winner she was polished showed policy depth and has the outsider bio that is so in vogue this year fiorina now has more momentum than any republican candidate not named trump has had in this campaign

rubio was also very sharp tonight but he seems unable to have the sorts of moments that get shared online and talked out around the dinner table which is why he went down not up in the polls after a similarly solid performance in the last debate

jeb bush was markedly better than the last debate which is like being the tallest of the seven dwarves but his most memorable moment was passionately defending his brother whose legacy is an albatross around his neck

ultimately the eventual democratic nominee was the biggest winner because the republicans continue to unlearn all the lessons of  by taking far right positions on immigration womens health and climate change

dan pfeiffer is a former senior adviser to president barack obama and served in the white house in a variety of roles including communications director

at nearly three hours this was a debate for the true political junkies to me the most resonant memory was that of the various republican presidential candidates on and off the camera crying jake jake to moderator jake tapper signaling their desire to jump into the discussion

ironically for a debate that took place at the ronald reagan library the  hopefuls showed that they differ in style from our th president reagan was known for his sunny disposition he was a genial man who did not hurl insults at his rivals he appealed to americans best selves with his innate optimism by contrast the republicans on the stage tonight presented a gloomy vision of our nation and at time acted peevish and petulant with one another  a far cry from the courtly reagan

yet for all the attacks on each other the candidates also missed opportunities to call each other out nobody pointed out that for much of her adult life carly fiorina did not bother to vote at all nobody mentioned that under sen marco rubios proposed overhaul of our immigration policies people like his working class parents would not have been allowed in the country nobody asked mike huckabee about the religious liberties of american muslims or mormons

the immigration portion of the debate meanwhile was a disappointment the immigration proposal that merited the most discussion was donald trumps impractical inhumane plan for mass deportations it was disheartening to see legitimate questions about immigration reform devolve into sniping about speaking spanish birthright citizenship and  of course  border security

any serious consideration of what to do with the estimated  million undocumented people already here was missing  as was any mention of the fact that conservative icon reagan signed the immigration and control act of  which allowed nearly  million undocumented immigrants to get amnesty after entering the country illegally

equally troubling was the fact that the black lives matter movement  one of the most powerful social justice movements of our time  did not merit any discussion

the winner tonight that would be fiorina she faced up to personal and professional attacks with aplomb her experience in corporate america has clearly given her the skills necessary for making a strong presentation not at all hesitant about asserting herself she proved that she belonged on the big stage tonight

the loser tonight was wisconsin gov scott walker he has been fading in the polls lately and this was his chance to show potential supporters and donors that he is still a major player instead between trumps bravado and the occasional flourishes of the other candidates  rubio on foreign policy fiorina on her business record  walker seemed to get lost in the shuffle unlike nearly every other candidate walker did not have one strong moment

like most i thought carly fiorina was tonights big winner i think her strongest moment had nothing to do with donald trump

the weak field helped trump kicked jeb bush around like a failed prospect on the apprentice bushs biggest applause line was defending his brother which im sure the hillary clinton campaign loved nearly all rushed to promise magical toughness fixes to the middle east and more deportations while failing to mention the economy until it was an excuse not to act on climate change

fiorina reminds me of a more human mitt romney she is a polished and poised debater the question is whether her business track record of mass layoffs comes back to haunt her as it did romney

but on wednesday tonight she combined personal stories with policy specifics better than anyone else on the stage asked about drug policy reform she gave a heartbreaking account of the loss of a child that moved every watching parent of all parties  and then transitioned seamlessly into a conservative case for reforming our criminal justice system

that answer was all the more impressive because it came in the midst of a number of strong responses that showed the broad consensus on scaling back our system of mass incarceration kudos to cnns jake tapper for posing a question that moved us past trumps noisy racism and provoked bushs apology to his mom fiorinas tearjerker and a healthy dose of substance

julian zelizer rivals figure out how to undercut trump

in the first half of the debate donald trump succeeded in his basic campaign strategy make the entire contest about him when most people were watching trump was continually a focal point of the discussion early on he launched a series of ad hominem attacks like telling rand paul he shouldnt even be on the stage and making quips about his looks

this has been his strategy since entering the race  constantly attack and constantly be attacked either way the result is that trump is the story in an age of mediadriven politics where video clips and quick sound bites are the currency of choice he advances his cause

during the first two hours the moderators often used trumps statements on immigration or on fiorinas business record for example as the basis of their questions to other candidates very often the split screen would show answers by someone like christie with the other half of the screen still on trump whether or not this was relevant

but during the last hour of the debate when fewer people were watching his opponents started to show that the best way to undercut is to talk about issues besides all the blows trump suffered including the basic message that he is an entertainer rather than a leader the camera was no longer focused on him

many of the candidates had their moments carly fiorina scored points with conservatives when she talked about defunding planned parenthood as well as her call for policies to help women in the workplace her overall performance including her retort to trumps comments about her appearance won applause sen marco rubio offered emotional answers to the questions about immigration and showed his chops on foreign policy

sen ted cruz got in a few criticisms of the supreme court while john kasich boasted of his deep experience and ability to move to the center

wisconsin gov scott walker touted the record of his administration while new jersey gov chris christie finally had a chance to talk about issues other than scandalous bridges including economic growth and law and order his performance gave a boost to a dying candidacy

paul discussed drugs and criminal justice as well as the need to limit american involvement overseas ben carson spoke about vaccine policies and defending free markets and wealth jeb bush had a chance to defend his brothers policies after  connecting his statements to how he would address terrorism

whenever foreign policy came up trump almost seemed to duck down behind his lectern just as important all of the candidates started to make tougher statements about former secretary of state hillary clinton remembering that ultimately she would be the main target of the gop who will prosecute hillary clinton asked christie

while this debate probably wont knock trump off from his pedestal it offers a road map to his opponents about how to undercut his success shifting to issues and shifting to policies  not allowing him to shape the entire conversation  is the best way to trump trump

winner anyone but trump although trump was not a clear loser

maria cardona rivals knew it was make or break

tonights debate finally started to break the trump fever the other gop candidates found their inner adults stood up to trump  somewhat  and importantly demonstrated their command and experience on policy details and their more realistic solutions to the countrys problems

while they are all wrong on the issues  their immigration divisiveness and their focus on defunding planned parenthood to the point of forcing a government shutdown are dangerous territory and weaken the partys general election viability  it was clear they all knew how much was riding on their performances

carly fiorina was masterful throughout the debate she was adroit witty and showed she would not back down but did so in a very graceful way she also schooled donald trump and many of the others on foreign policy and other issues she played and looked the part

marco rubio shone brightly when discussing foreign policy and his and fiorinas command of subject matter was a stark contrast with trump who was completely absent from the discussion

jeb bush did a much better job this time around but still lost tonight he is such a cringeworthy awkward candidate and while he went toe to toe with trump at times and had a good funny line towards the end when asked what secret service code name he would choose  eveready he said looking at trump because its high energy  he looked uncomfortable in his own skin every time he tried to defend himself or get tough with trump

will this be the beginning of the dimming of trump who up until now had gotten away with myths bluster distortions and outright lies in the place of facts solutions pragmatic approaches respect and grace still early to say but at least the candidates scored some important points against trump and used the opportunity to let voters get to know them better

the biggest winner from thursday nights cnn republican presidential candidate debate carly fiorina not only did she speak with expertise and fluency on policy but fiorina added some emotional inflection and personal touches to connect with the voters most importantly of all she managed to be the first candidate to go toetotoe with trump on stage and come out the clear victor

fiorina was joined by several other candidates with standout performances sen marco rubio who if not the eventual president might make a great secretary of state came off as polished on stage and wonky on policy the same was true for sen ted cruz who burnished his constitutionalist credentials at every opportunity and focused his fire on president barack obamas administration rather than his fellow gop candidates gov chris christie for his part also turned in a solid performance as he managed to pull off both bravado and charm  even managing to sound earnestly conservative a few times

the biggest loser tonight donald trump not only because he clearly didnt win but he even failed to be the center of attention beyond the opening minutes of the debate trump is of course style over substance but even his style faltered tonight

and while he had a few entertaining humorous moments trump also had some headshaking blunders his nonapology to fiorina where he called her beautiful crashed and burned  you could almost hear the groans across america

others in the not good enough category were sen rand paul gov scott walker and gov john kasich all of of whom may be following gov rick perrys lead in exiting the race much sooner than they anticipated

surprisingly this was not episode no  of the trump and friends reality show that many expected and frankly some hoped for from an entertainment point of view

this was much more of a substantive debate in part because the candidates refused to fight with each other or the moderators  with a few exceptions ie donald trump versus rand paul this allowed the debate to reveal a contrast between the candidates who were pandering offering conservative gop primary voters red meat on issues and those candidates who were being realistic and responsible such as on issues like immigration and the iran nuclear deal

for example jake tapper challenged donald trump using a quote of ben carson about his plan to deport the  million plus undocumented immigrants as being unworkable we heard ted cruz boast that he would tear up the iran deal if elected president but trump and ohio gov john kasich focused on enforcing the agreement and carly fiorina called out trumps proposal to end birthright citizenship as being wholly impracticable because it would require amending the th amendment

the race is now moving from the reality show mode to one of substance which might be a little less exciting but better for voters in assessing the candidates

once again carly fiorina stole the show her comfort level on stage command of the issues and her ability to deliver razor sharp responses cut down donald trump with the precision of a political scalpel fiornia accomplished something no other candidate on that stage was yet to do she made donald trump and his egomaniacal larger than life candidacy look small

while trump engaged in his typical nonsequitur ad hominem attacks fiorina came across thoughtful prepared and tough on issues both foreign and domestic when jake tapper asked fiorina to respond to trumps insult of her face during a rolling stone interview and his attempt to walk it back by claiming that he meant her persona not her looks she simply said to thunderous applause i think women all over this country heard very clearly what mr trump said

at that point trump pulled up lame he responded i think she has a beautiful face shes a beautiful woman which was met with crickets and collective incredulity from the audience it was one of the most memorable exchanges of the night it felt as though trump showed up prepared for a comedy central roast not a debate to help decide the next leader of the free world

another standout moment came during a discussion on defunding planned parenthood over its fetal organ harvesting controversy when fiorina looked into the camera and challenged president obama and hillary clinton to watch these tapes  watch a fully formed fetus on the table its heart beating its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain  this is about the character of our nation and if we will not stand up and force president obama to veto this bill shame on us a man sitting next to me said i just got goose bumps as did i

both carly fiorina and sen marco rubio who in his own right had another very strong night especially on foreign policy matters came across as the adults in the room and delivered powerful performances on issues that resonate with the american people well see if thats reflected in the polls moving forward

6162,BREXIT REVOLT CASTS A SHADOW OVER HILLARY CLINTONS CAUTIOUS PATH  THE NEW YORK TIMES,for hillary clinton britains emotionally charged uprising against the european union is the sort of populist victory over establishment politics that she fears in the coming presidential election mrs clinton shares more with the defeated remain campaign than a similar slogan     her stronger together echoing its stronger in  her fundamental argument much akin to prime minister david camerons against british withdrawal from the european union is that americans should value stability and incremental change over the risks entailed in radical change and the possibility of chaos if donald j trump wins the presidency she offers reasonableness instead of resentment urging voters to see the big picture and promising to manage economic and immigration upheaval just as mr cameron did she too is a pragmatic internationalist battling against nationalist anger cautioning that the turmoil after the   brexit vote underscores a need for calm steady experienced leadership in the white house  but prudence is cold comfort to people fed up with     according to their friends and advisers mrs clinton and former president bill clinton have worried for months that she was out of sync with the mood of the electorate and that her politically safe messages     like im a progressive who gets results     were far less compelling to frustrated voters than the political revolution of senator bernie sanders or mr trumps   promise to make america great again  mr sanders and mr trump won a combined  million votes during the primary season compared with  million for mrs clinton and while many of mr sanderss supporters are expected to support her in november she has not recalibrated her message to try to tap into the anger that he and mr trump channeled nor does mrs clinton have any plans advisers say to take cues from the brexit campaign and start   her support for globalized markets or denouncing porous borders illegal immigrants and the lack of job protections in   agreements much distinguishes the presidential contest from the british fight of course including a    matchup between   candidates a sharply different economic context and a long and proud history of immigration yet in addition to worrying that she is out of step mrs clinton is somewhat hemmed in by her record she supported her husbands north american free trade agreement which caused significant economic pain in the industrial midwest after it went into effect in  and her nuanced views about free trade are a harder sell to many voters than mr trumps   vows to trash bad trade deals and use tariffs as economic weapons of national defense while mrs clinton is counting on mr trumps history of racist and sexist remarks to doom his candidacy thursdays brexit referendum was an unnerving reminder that voter anger is deeper and broader than many elite politicians and veteran pollsters realize in swing states like ohio many democrats and republicans yearn for an economic comeback and are not confident that mrs clinton understands their frustrations or has the ideas and wherewithal to deliver the sort of change that could satisfy them brexit is clearly a cautionary tale for the clinton campaign not to get too complacent with a potential victory said david b cohen a professor of political science at the university of akron trump sanders and those in great britain who ran the leave campaign are tapping into an anger and anxiety that is clearly festering   folks in the united states are similar to   folks in europe and a lot of those   people feel as if the international economic system is not working for them and strangling the middle class  mike duhaime a republican strategist said the british vote was the clearest sign yet that the intensity against the status quo is far more real than many are still willing to acknowledge  if the trump victory in the primary wasnt enough of one the brexit vote serves as a major   call indicating just how frustrated average voters are with those in power mr duhaime said several democrats cautioned against drawing too many lessons from the brexit vote saying mass immigration and economic malaise were bigger problems in britain and the european union than in the united states they also said many british voters were revolting against a bureaucracy in brussels that they regarded as bloated overpaid and prone to interfering in the affairs of sovereign countries yet the democrats acknowledged that the worldview held by mrs clinton and many of the partys elites was not as attractive to many voters as it once was liberal internationalism seems to have been dying for a while said mark s mellman a democratic pollster who is not involved with the clinton campaign but while that may be the animating philosophy of foreign policy intellectuals the world over it is not the animating philosophy of america nor of our domestic politics  for sean harrington a husband and father of three who owns the town pump tavern in downtown detroit the support for   deals and international markets cannot die fast enough taking a break from his bookkeeping duties on friday he said president clintons economic policies were still ruining the economy by giving benefits to large corporations that move jobs overseas while in states like michigan the average work force loses  if my fellow americans were doing better there would be more money around and traded in and out of my pockets said mr harrington a registered independent who is undecided between mrs clinton and mr trump on the campaign trail mrs clinton regularly pledges to make sure our economy works for everyone not just those at the top as she put it on wednesday in raleigh n c where she also promised to reject bad trade deals and unfair trade practices  she also argued in favor of britains remaining in the european union but she was not surprised that the leave campaign won her advisers said friday because she understands the extent of voter anger her advisers said they were confident the referendum in britain did not mirror the presidential election in the united states these are two different countries with very different circumstances and demographics facing different choices said jennifer palmieri mrs clintons communications director we believe american voters are looking for concrete solutions to address their economic frustrations and unlikely to find the turmoil economic uncertainty and roiling of markets caused by the brexit vote particularly appealing  frank luntz a republican expert on political messaging said mr cameron and the remain camp had failed to personalize individualize or humanize their campaign  the stronger together slogan shared by the remain campaign and mrs clinton feels bloodless and overly intellectual compared with the more emotional   appeals of mr trump and the leave movement he said the problem with the concept of together is that it promotes groupthink rather than individual pursuits mr luntz said we are in an age of individual action not collective responsibility  mrs clintons arguments against mr trump often require a great deal of explanation to voters which can sometimes turn them off while mr trump thrills his audiences with big promises     without saying much about how he would fulfill them     mrs clinton can get caught in the gears of policy one recent exception was a foreign policy speech in early june when she hit a rhythm and ripped into mr trump with memorable lines like he says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the miss universe pageant in russia  but when mrs clinton takes pains to explain why mr trumps promises and policies do not add up or are too risky she runs a risk of her own that she will sound as though she is instructing or talking down to her audience not many voters want a lecturer as president a slogan and a message must be aspirational     either give people hope things will get better or that the bad stuff will stop     both said ruth sherman a political communications analyst who is not affiliated with any campaign referring to one of mrs clintons taglines she said hillarys im with her     i remember thinking when i first saw it really its not my job to be with her she should be with me  if mr trumps make america great again is resonant     by far the best slogan of all the candidates ms sherman said     mrs clinton is counting on voters to appreciate policy ideas that are more strategic than   she argued in raleigh for instance that markets like the european union work best when all the stakeholders share in the benefits  while that statement was hardly in the aspirational vein that ms sherman recommends it set a clear goal and was less divisive than mr trumps comments on the british referendum the american electorate has tilted this year toward presidential candidates who make them feel as much as think but mrs clinton and her allies hope that voters will reflect on the vote in britain and opt for the steadiness and predictability that she promises i dont think the average american who has a retirement account right now is thrilled about donald trumps support of brexit said thomas r nides who was a deputy secretary of state under mrs clinton hillary clinton understands we always need to change     but change that doesnt cause unintended consequences for the average american ,0,1542,7669,10/6/2019,TikTok
6163,KASICHS OHIO WIN PUSHES GOP RACE CLOSER TO CHAOTIC CONVENTION,"donald trump expanded his commanding delegate lead tuesday night by winning primary contests in illinois north carolina and the winnertakeall state of florida prompting senator marco rubio to suspend his campaign and bringing the republican frontrunner one step closer to securing the partys nomination for president while trump lost the winnertakeall state of ohio to the states governor john kasich slowing his potential path to the white house the billionaire developer remains the oddson favorite to become the partys standardbearer in july absent a conventionfloor fight that could see gop leaders elevate kasich or ted cruz in defiance of the republican electorate

democratic frontrunner hillary clinton also cleaned up tuesday shaking off her surprise loss last week to rival bernie sanders in michigan by winning ohio florida illinois and north carolina delivering a muchneeded jolt of momentum to her campaign sanders gave clinton a run for her money in each state picking up a share of the nights delegates but remains hundreds of delegates behind in the overall counta gap that may prove insurmountable especially if sanders is unable to convince clintons hundreds of superdelegates to switch sides as of  am the missouri presidential primaries both remained too close to call with trump and clinton ahead by just  percent each

despite trump and clintons dominating performances tuesdays results all but guarantee that both races will continue until this summer and in the gops case potentially after sanders controls a massive campaign war chest as well as the proven ability to continue raising huge sums of moneythe vermont senator raised more than  million in the day following his victory in michiganand has indicated he is willing to spend big to win all the way until the democratic national convention in july on the republican side the window is closing to prevent trump from reaching the  delegates needed to clinch the gop nomination but party leaders have made no secret of their intentions to block him no matter what even if trump surpasses that threshold establishment party figures have indicated they could change convention rules or even launch a conservative thirdparty challengea suicide mission but one some republicans see as a necessary corrective to the existential threat posed by trumps insurgent candidacy either way cruz and kasich are likely to remain in the race for the long haul ensuring a threemonth slog to what is sure to be a chaotic convention in cleveland

in an election season defined by roiling anger toward washington elites and economic policies that have contributing to a widening income gap kasichs rousing victory in ohio and geewhiz positivity may be just a blip amid the wider revolt driving donald trump and to a lesser extend bernie sanders clinton has managed with some success to absorb that populist rage running to the left by condemning wall street greed and turning against trade deals she previously supported the republican establishment however which long held together its unwieldy coalition of economic elites and working class whites by merging a probusiness platform with social conservatism may not survive in its current form

the astounding popularity of trump a nationalist with little ideology beyond his belief that he is the sole candidate capable of restoring american greatness has exposed the lie at the heart of the party the majority of the conservative base doesnt care about small business principles they just want someone who will keep immigrants out and tell it like it is after all the limitedgovernment ideology preached by the gop may have made their lives worse whether or not trump can secure the delegates he needs to lock up the republican nominationa feat that will require winning some  percent of all remaining delegates from here on outthe damage to the gop will have been done",0,626,3256,24/5/2022,The Guardian

6166,BARREL BOMB THE CATACLYSMIC CLOSE OF CAMPAIGN        INFORMATION," barrel bomb the cataclysmic close of campaign  by chris floyd
 well here we are at the bottom of the barrel under forty feet of slag in a few days time well know our fate the fivealarm fire of trump rule oh how those police unions are chomping at the bit or the clinton age of hyperwar oh how those neocons are chomping at the bit in either case the entrenched coagulation of corporate interests and war profiteers that have strangled the peace prosperity and prospects of the american people will not be budged an inch the change that people are so desperately hungry for  so hungry that that some of them might well elect an establishment insider whose sinister clowning makes him appear to be a rebel  will not come thus their bitterness will grow deeper more sour erupting more and more often in physical violence from militarized police against protestors from trumpempowered racists if he wins or loses from extremist militias from angry maddened people on every side and of course there will be more  much more  of the horrific neverending globespanning violence of the bipartisan terror war that churns on and on no matter who is sitting temporarily in the white house
theres no use in pretending thats not what we face but theres also no use in pretending that this situation is somehow sui generis  some terribly unlucky conflation of unforeseen circumstances coming together at this particular time it is in fact the culmination and embodiment of the deliberate choices of the most powerful forces in society the choices to enrich themselves beyond all reason and extend their military and economic dominance over the earth
it doesnt matter that many if not most of the practitioners and functionaries of this system believe in its rightness it doesnt matter that brutal neoliberal nostrums and extremist imperial notions have become religious dogmas for those who see themselves as the meritocracy it doesnt matter if the leaders and factotums genuinely believe in the exceptionalism they preach or if they are cynical powerseekers it doesnt matter if they actually believe their rapacious financial machinations are reflections of the natural law of the the market that will eventually benefit all or if they know themselves to be what they really are ugly souls disfigured by greed the end result has been the same a long series of deliberate choices by a bipartisan elite that have hollowed out the lives and communities and futures of millions of americans and created a living hell of war ruin and hatred over much of the earth
this is a system that has delegitimized itself a system that has undermined its own institutions through its own actions it has rotted out the foundations of trust and reason which once upheld it some might say oh but theres been a decadeslong concentrated effort by rightwing billionaires and corporate forces to foment ideological and religious extremism to undermine the legitimacy of secular government which might restrict their profiteering or let more people have a share in power and thats true but its been accompanied at every step by the collusion and cowardice of the putative opposition the socalled new democrats exemplified by the clintons jettisoned concern for the common good to embrace centrist and technocratic policies ie to adopt the neoliberal dogma that unbridled pursuit of private profit by a connected elites will somehow someday lead to general prosperity the idea that the party should fight to improve the lives of ordinary people in the here and now to fight for their quality of life in a genuine substantive way came to be seen as oldhat a quaint and fusty notion of hasbeens and dreamers who didnt understand the way the world really worked a true savvy moderate knows you must compromise every ideal show yourself to be a willing and avid servant of the monied interests and the militarists in order to gain power so you can make a few cosmetic changes around the edges a few little social improvements here and there but only  of course  in partnership with private interests but never ever challenge the system at its core
this is the only deal in town outright unvarnished rightwing rule or simpering cowardly moderate management of a violent rapacious system thats been the choice on offer since  thats the choice on offer today the only difference is that the system has metastasized to a monstrous degree over the years lacking any genuine opposition the system has grown more violent more rapacious
establishment collusion  and democratic cowardice  finally and completely degraded and delegitimized the american electoral process  years ago when the supreme court  with two members who had direct family ties to the bush campaign  stopped a recount that would have resulted in the actual winner of the election to take office this outrageous action was accepted by every single organ and institution of the american system with the momentary exception of the black congressional caucus whose members tried in vain to get a single democratic senator to challenge the result instead americans were encouraged to applaud the fact that power had changed hands without tanks in the street that is we were to celebrate that an actual coup detat had taken place before our eyes without the slightest show of resistance
once in place the coup regime  staffed at the highest levels by extremists who a year before had publicly called for a vast militarization of american policy and society even if the public had to be galvanized by a new pearl harbor  led the nation into a disastrous war based on false pretenses a vast crime that not only killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people but has led directly to unbridled turmoil extremism conflict and corruption around the world the elitesupported coup regime instituted torture programs and death squads and launched an orgy of war profiteering unprecedented in world history the regime then presided over the worst economic collapse in generations
not a single member of the regime was ever tried  or even investigated at even the most preliminary level  for a single crime committed during its time in power there were no highprofile congressional investigations into the hideous carnage and ruin and instability they wrought not even a chilcot commission into the origins of the war as the uk belatedly launched instead the regimes leaders and top factotums were heaped with honors and wealth today their endorsement is eagerly sought  and gained  by the progressive democratic candidate for president
in  the desperate electorate turned to a figure presented to them as an outsider who would at last bring real change he had the trappings of difference  a black man with a muslim name who spoke eloquently of peace and social justice who most people thought was far to the left but voted for him anyway but barack obama was of course a meritocratic centrist to his core riding an enormous wave of popularity and a strong congressional majority he proceeded to bail out wall street fraudsters and finaglers with tax money and create a health care system based on the plan of a rightwing thinktank that prioritized corporate profit  and probably killed the chance for a genuinely public health care system for generations if not for good he also doubled down on the terror war expanding it to more countries extended bushs death squads helped destroy nations like libya and yemen thus spawning more chaos and terror expanded illegal surveillance of the populace and the world to an extent beyond the wildest dreams of the stasi or kgb and after saving big money from itself and securing the guaranteed profits of the healthcareinsurance corporate complex he spent most of his time on the domestic front trying to strike a grand bargain with republicans to cut social security and medicare
again all hopes of any real change were thwarted so now the nation swings from being ready to embrace a perceived leftist to the brink of voting in a bellicose rightist as it seeks the genuine change no one will give them of course after the scorchedearth tactics of bipartisan neoliberalism and the inevitable moral degradation and brutalization that comes from year after year after year of vicious aggressive war the choice for trump is more nihilistic its as if people believe positive change is no longer possible  so lets tear everything down and see what happens this is the actual open philosophy of the breitbart gang who are now directing trumps campaign
even if clinton wins this nihilism will still be rampant and given that she happily embodies the bipartisan establishment now roundly despised on all sides for its many depredations the nihilism will grow even worse  especially as she has given no indication whatsoever that she will even try to make substantive changes in the neoliberalmilitarist system that is strangling us quite the contrary
so yes this has been a campaign like no other  but mostly because it has brought the systematic decay of the republic into the sharpest possible relief and has shown more clearly than before that the neoliberalmilitarist ascendency offers no hope for a better life a better world indeed that it offers nothing at all  except more violence more bitterness more ruin more degradation for us all

iranians spend  of their annual earnings on beauty products three times more than their european counterparts as per official statistics the germans spend  and the french and british  of their income every year on cosmetics
according to data from the iranian association of cosmetics toiletries and perfumery importers iran accounts for  billion of the middle easts  billion beauty products marketsecond in the region after saudi arabia the persian daily shahrvand reported
it is said that there are  million consumers for cosmetic products in iran dividing the annual turnover by this number shows that each consumer spends  on cosmetics per year germanys online statistics portal statista states that the per capita cosmetic spending in europe is   on average the index is  in germany  in france  in britain  in italy and  in spain
if the raw figures alone are taken iranians spend less than europeans on makeup products but the results change as other parameters such as the price of products and household average earnings are taken into account as well
as confirmed by the iranian association of cosmetics toiletries and perfumery importers  of the cosmetics in the market are smuggled into the country and often sold at a lower price than they would be if they were legally imported not to mention the health risks contraband products are likely to pose europeans on the other hand pay the real price of the products which includes tax and are thus more expensive

this means that iranians spend  of their income on beauty products while the figure is  for germans  for the french and british  for italians and  for the spanish
these calculations show that people in iran spend three times as much on cosmetics as german french and british consumers

additionally irans oral and maxillofacial surgeons association has announced that  cosmetic surgeries are performed each year constituting  of the operations in the world this is a rather large percentage given that only  of the world population lives in iran besides the figure is said to be approximate due to the absence of an official registration system and the fact that other types of beauty surgeries such as body contouring and facial rejuvenation among many others are not included
data from the central bank and the statistics center of iran suggest that cultural pursuits constitute a small portion of iranian household expenditure the reports indicate that each family spent only  of their income on recreation and cultural activities in  less than half their expenses on cosmetic products

that whether we are black or brown or white we all bleed the same red blood of patriots we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great american flag and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of detroit or the windswept plains of nebraska they look up at the same night sky they fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator so to all americans in every city near and far small and large from mountain to mountain from ocean to ocean hear these words you will never be ignored again your voice your hopes and your dreams will define our american destiny and your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way together we will make america strong again we will make america wealthy again we will make america proud again we will make america safe again and yes together we will make america great again trumps inaugural address reportedly written by chief strategist stephen k bannon and senior advisor stephen miller was criticized as aggressive but it was largely an effort to explain what he meant by make america great again which is thankfully a very aggressive idea for an example of a passive campaign theme try hope and change  there is nothing more passive than lying around and hoping some santa claus politician comes along with a bag of other peoples money to fix your life  trump was also criticized for delivering an inaugural address that sounded too much like his campaign speeches this was necessary because the mainstream media didnt relay enough of what he said on the stump they were too busy freaking out over whatever outrageous thing he said at any given rally  it was appropriate for trump to succinctly explain his platform to the widest audience hell ever have both within and beyond americas borders with no media filter until now most of the media commentary on make america great again consisted of whining about how unfair it was to the inexplicably   barack obama mixed with the occasional lefty primal scream about how america was never great to begin with perhaps most importantly trump used his inaugural to beat down the asinine smear of white nationalism  his talk of national pride has been corrupted to mean unthinking national chauvinism by the left america first is twisted to mean screw everybody but america or in the hands of the more mendacious critics screw the jews  then it gets twisted even further by welding the unspoken word white onto nationalism transforming it into a racist call to arms the number of actual white nationalists who talk about white nationalism is vastly smaller than the number of liberals who insist thats what they hear when trump talks about american pride  maybe its time for liberals to check in with their therapists and have a long talk about why they hear so many racist dog whistles in his inaugural trump could not have been more clear about the inclusiveness of his vision for american pride whether we are black or brown or white we all bleed the same red blood of patriots is about as clear as it gets  of course the usual   media swamis will declare theyve looked inside trumps mind and he didnt really mean that he just threw those words in because kellyanne told him he needed a little racism insurance but everything about that speech and everything trump has said about resurgent american pride and everything said by the people who want to reclaim nationalism from chauvinism is inclusive the point is to insist on both national priorities and national responsibilities for everyone from   citizens at the immigration office to president trump and his cabinet  the woman from mexico who took her oath of citizenship yesterday is  american the man from mexico who slipped across the border in a coyote truck yesterday is not president trump has a long list of sacred duties to the woman but not to the man this is not a complicated idea or a racist one or really even a nationalist one its civics  its also the idea global socialism must strangle in order to survive liberals who rail against nationalism are primarily interested in creating a world of zero accountability for their maximum leaders with borders erased the ruling class can hack the electorate to suit its political needs and their business partners can slash the cost of labor internationalist leaders are accountable to no nations citizens trumps inaugural address included a bold statement of the opposite principle americas president has neither control nor responsibility over the economies of other nations he is responsible to americans from nebraska to detroit as trump put it he set a very high bar for himself to clear by pointedly mentioning detroit  he also made a promise that no group will be preyed upon for the advantages of another to be the president of all americans means he is the sugar daddy of none no more will the power of government be used to penalize groups the left hates and beat them into line with new social orthodoxies no more will washington dream up economic plans that benefit some or even most while designating certain forgotten people as lifetime losers who need to shut up and accept their fate  trump referred to wealth several times in his speech wealth means more than just money wealth benefits all no matter how loudly socialists may screech about too much of it accruing to the one percent some people got very rich by designing building and selling the device youre staring at right now you are wealthier than your grandparents because you have it as for a proud americas proper relationship with other nations trump said we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example we will shine for everyone to follow thats not chauvinism or imperialism thats the understanding america was founded upon when thomas jefferson took his turn at the presidential bat he called for peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none  no one interpreted that to mean to hell with the rest of the world  also not to put too fine a point on it but just about every other nation on earth understands the concept of putting its own interests first and believes it has a moral obligation to do so the leaders of some other nations are very good at murmuring sweet globalist nothings into the ears of   elites but what they actually do is ruthlessly pursue their own national interests the charade is made much easier for them by the universal understanding that america is supposed to be the one country that never gets to look out for itself that has no moral right to protect its own interests those are all much easier promises to make than keep to be sure but trump did make them it is wise to be skeptical and hold his feet to the very large fire he built with that inaugural address,0,1281,6014,3/12/2020,TikTok

the video which is reportedly from the aguascalientes in south mexico shows a woman lying on a bed recording a video message for her boyfriend as she bites down on a cookie she says she feels strange before dropping her phone and appearing to have a seizure


after a few terrifying seconds the door to the room slams shut seemingly by itself before the woman breaks out of the alleged possession and runs out of the room screaming


strange noises can then be heard after she leaves the room which could possibly be interpreted as spinechilling screams from hell or maybe a friendly elephant squealing on a nearby television

according to the yucatan informa the woman is doing fine and doesnt appear to be possessed any more

6175,TEXAS SENATE VOTES TO CURB TRANSGENDER ACCESS TO PUBLIC BATHROOMS,austin texas reuters  the republicancontrolled texas senate gave preliminary approval on tuesday to a bill that restricts bathroom access for transgender people endorsing a piece of legislation denounced by civil liberties advocates as discriminatory final senate adoption of the bill was possible later on tuesday or wednesday the measure would then be sent to the state house of representatives where passage during a day special legislative session that ends in midaugust is less certain despite a republican majority in that body as well the preliminary vote in the senate was  with one democrat crossing the aisle to vote with the republican majority in favor of the measure senate bill  enactment in texas the mostpopulous republicandominated state could give momentum in other socially conservative states for additional action on an issue that has become a flashpoint in the us culture wars the texas measure requires that all restrooms showers and locker rooms in public schools and other state and local government facilities must be designated for and used only by persons of the same sex as stated on a persons birth certificate as opposed to their gender identity the measure also would overturn local ordinances affirming transgender bathroom rights in such cities as austin san antonio and dallas  supporters including republican lieutenant governor dan patrick a staunch social conservative have said the proposed bathroom restrictions promote public safety and protect vulnerable women and children momentum for socalled bathroom bills stalled earlier this year when a similar law in north carolina was partially repealed in march the original law prompted boycotts by a number of athletic organizations and businesses that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars opponents in texas warned of a similar backlash the state of texas cannot afford discriminatory acts democratic senator borris miles said during debate on the bill the bills sponsor republican senator lois kolkhorst said there was no solid evidence showing that enacting the bill would hurt the states economy perhaps we will find that this one bill will lead to more economic activity she said business leaders socially progressive clergy and police chiefs of several major texas cities have called on lawmakers to halt the bathroom bill saying it does not protect the public civil rights groups said there were already laws on the books protecting people from sexual assaults and voyeurism and that enactment of sb  would further endanger transgender people who are more prone to be victims of violence the texas senate previously passed a bathroom bill during the regular legislative session that ended in may but the measure died in the house under pressure from probusiness republicans texas house speaker joe straus a moderate republican who steers that chambers agenda has said such measures are unnecessary and raise worries of economic harm ,0,465,2491,25/10/2020,Facebook
6176,AGENT ANGELINA ARE CIA USING HOLLYWOODS JOLIE AS SOFT POWER OPERATIVE,st century wire says in previous articles wire has consistently raised the question of whether or not the cia and the pentagon have been using hollywood celebrities as soft power pawns in order to help grease foreign policy objects over seas this charge has always been met by narrow mainstream minds as a  conspiracy theory    even though we have provided evidence which indicates this is a very real practice and one with historic precedents seems that the mainstream claim that  the cia wouldn t hire someone like that  won t fly anymore  we have talked about dennis rodman and george clooney as two highprofile  ambassadors  of the us inserted into trouble areas in order to achieve various pr strategic or intelligence endsthis latest admission regarding actress angelina jolie is even more telling   where it is claimed she was being used as an expensive honey pot to lure the illusive and possibly nonexistent joseph kony of the lord s resistance army in the jungles of ugandaandrew korybko oriental reviewit s long been suspected that the actress willingly promotes cia psyop narratives in her films but this time new leaks allege that angelina jolie had also at one time considered being the pentagon s  bait  to  catch kony  which draws into question the true motivation of other celebrities  foreign policy forays such as dennis rodman s  friendship  with kim jongun agent angelinaangelina jolie is the poster woman for the  hollywoodintelligence complex  the perfect example of a willing cia asset who regularly goes along with  deep state  narratives in her films such as the antiserb production  in the land of blood and honey  she s also been one of the loudest global cheerleaders for  humanitarian interventions  abroad or in other words imperialist wars waged under distorted or outright fabricated  humanitarian  reasons such as the one that she had been lobbying for in darfur jolie often visits us troops abroad like in afghanistan though up until now there were no grounds for suggesting that she was anything other than a propagandist as it would have been ordinarily absurd to even countenance her playing an active role in the battlefieldthat s no longer the case anymore though according to a report by the sunday times a ukbased media outlet which claims to have read leaked international criminal court icc documents alleging that the starlet told the organization s former chief prosecutor that she d be willing to volunteer herself as a bait to catch the phantasmal african warlord joseph kony the sunday times article is mostly hidden behind a paywall however so the average information consumer needs to rely on secondhand sources such as people magazine in order to learn about what s in those leaks free of charge according to the celebrity news site a hoard of  icc documents leaked to the french investigative website mediapart reveals that jolie once offered to act as human bait in a trap to arrest brutal ugandan warlord joseph konyshe  has the idea to invite kony to dinner and then arrest him  reads an email sent by former icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo reports the sunday times forget other celebrities she is the one  moreno ocampo adds in another email  she loves to arrest kony she is ready probably brad pitt will go also according to the sunday times which has seen the mediapart documents moreno ocampo hoped that jolie and her now estranged husband would travel to the central african republic with a team of us special forcesit was thought that their presence would then draw kony out of his armored compound and enable the us forces to take him into custody if these allegations are true then it would mean that jolie had graduated from the usual propagandist class of hollywood operatives to an infield asset of the pentagon in conspiring to carry out a globally important mission truth be told  catching kony  as the viral  slogan went isn t really that significant of a deal because the warlord is thought to have barely any supporters nowadays after years on the run in the transnational jungled space between his native uganda the democratic republic of the congo south sudan and the central african republic in fact the whole purpose of the cia psyop to  catch kony  was to  justify  us special forces  presence in this strategic region long enough for them to manufacture civil wars in south sudan and the central african republic which would turn them into a  failed state belt  that forever prevents their crucial incorporation into a chinesebuilt bicoastal silk road through their resourcerich territoriesthe geopolitics of the kony diversion aren t the focus of this article so it s recommended that readers review some of the author s hyperlinked analyses above if they re interested in learning more about this hybrid war campaign instead it s important to focus on the relationship between celebrities and the  deep state  both in the propaganda and   as can now be seen   infield operational manifestations thus far it doesn t seem like any of jolie s peers attempted to follow in her footsteps by partaking in such a highprofile covert mission but toning down the drama just a notch and removing the lethal risk involved in her extreme example it s certainly possible that other  famous people  are doing something similar in serving their governmentsodd couple joseph kony  angelina joliethe rodmankim casethe most relevant case that comes to mind is dennis rodman who s the us   kim whisperer  in passing along messages through what he calls  basketball diplomacy  but who actually functions as the best american pair of eyes and ears that has ever gotten to known the reclusive north korean leader in person it s been speculated for a few years already that rodman might indeed be working for the cia but this was always dismissed by more mainstream voices who retort that he s either  too stupid  or that  the cia wouldn t hire someone like that  but these critics never take the time to consider that rodman might be coerced into doing this in order to avoid a hushedup drug bust or something of that naturein any case his last visit to the communist country was a failure because he wasn t allowed to meet with kim jongun although he did claim credit for jailed provocateur otto warmbier s release shortly before his death given that the american student was going to die anyway from what was likely complications from his unsuccessful suicide attempt in trying to overdose on sleeping medicine he probably would have been released whether rodman came to the country or not but it s very telling that kim jongun refused to meet with his  best friend  during this time incidentally it was shortly after this that the war of words and  insult diplomacy  between the north korean and american leaders really took off which might have been inspired by trump finding out from his intelligence chiefs that they had lost their precious rodmankim connection because pyongyang could have figured out what the basketballer was really up toalthough it s only speculation at this point it would indeed explain why trump made a show out of appearing to go crazy and resorting to the  madman theory  in dealing with kim jongun as the us intelligence community might have concluded that this is the only realistic way left for directly communicating with his north korean counterpart with rodman s last reconnaissance mission cut short and ultimately unsuccessful the us might have feared that kim was signaling to them that he was prepared to imminently flex his muscles in vengeful showmanship for having been deceived this long and while it s impossible to know exactly what he was in fact thinking north korea did end up staging several highly provocative missile launches this summer after rodman s visit and even carried out a nuclear testthe above narrative might sound dubious upon first read but it certainly deserves to be reconsidered in light of the revelation that angelina jolie was working with the pentagon as part of a highly secret special operation to  catch kony  which would in that case not make it sound so crazy to imagine that dennis rodman might have been doing similar field work for the cia in collecting valuable personal intelligence about kim jonguneven if the north koreans are actually aware of what rodman is up to nowadays that doesn t mean that he ll never be allowed back into what some have derisively called the  hermit kingdom  as there s a certain value that could be derived from continuing to use him for informal diplomatic purposes and indirect communication with the us  deep state continue this story at

6183,HURRAY FOR THE RIFF RAFFS ALYNDA SEGARRA FINDS HERSELF IN A CONCEPT ALBUM  THE NEW YORK TIMES,alynda segarra knows what its like to live between cultures as a lonely teenager in the bronx she would regularly escape downtown soaking up latin poetry slams at the nuyorican poets cafe and hanging out with crusty punks in tompkins square park i always remember punk kids saying to me youre not puerto rican youre white ms segarra said and the puerto rican kids would say who dresses like you who are you really  the question stung because ms segarra herself didnt know the answer i hadnt internalized my heritage she said i was still finding most of my heroes in white men feeling like theyre the ones who make history i believed what was shoved down my throat  the art she made reflected that view even deep into her s as ms segarra rose as a critically admired   on three albums released under the band name hurray for the riff raff she kept her lineage at bay instead her music explored the blues and folk roots of americana only last year as she approached her th birthday did ms segarra confront her internalized cultural exile with the intent to reconcile the disparate strands of her identity the results can be heard on her ambitious new work with the band due on friday the navigator a    concept album that traces the wanderings of a character named navita milagros negrn ms segarra fashioned the story as an imaginary off broadway play starring the musicians directed by its producer and featuring a faux playbill to guide listeners through the music uses her contradictions to her advantage mixing rock guitars with bomba rhythms while melding original lyrics with some verse from the puerto rican poet pedro pietri the songs connect the dots in a long history of latin influences in popular music from the   harmonies of   to brill building hits like save the last dance for me to the   of mink deville on a recent winter afternoon ms segarra returned to the nuyorican poets cafe to discuss her early alienation framing it in part as a product of assimilation when she was growing up her mother ninfa segarra had a thriving career as an educator and a politician rising to become the deputy mayor of new york under rudolph w giuliani her father was a vice principal and a music teacher in the bronx where he taught the singer and actor marc anthony as a youth the couple split when ms segarra was a child and she was reared mainly by her   aunt and uncle in marble hill ms segarras father introduced her to the clave rhythms of   music yet she gravitated more toward the videos of dean martin and frank sinatra beloved by her aunt and uncle puberty ignited in her a rebellious side which found reflection in punk bands like the dead kennedys and bikini kill i started to feel very angry about my place in the world as a girl ms segarra said i wanted to go wherever i wanted without fear of danger to be treated the same as my brother  in high school she formed an acoustic punk group with other young women modeled on the music of the   singer kimya dawson she also began to spend more time in the east village identifying with women who shaved their heads but not their armpits failing in school and feeling like a drain on her family ms segarra ran away from home to squat on the lower east side i was really scared     and really hungry she said but i was determined to live the life of an artist that everyone said was impossible  aching for experience and escape ms segarra took to the road hopping trains until she finally ended up settling in new orleans by her th birthday there she found street kids she connected with more deeply together they began performing songs by woody guthrie whose wanderings ms segarras own had echoed she lived by busking getting good enough at her craft to make home recordings that earned some buzz starting with it dont mean i dont love you  in  ms segarra was signed to ato records for small town heroes which proved a critical breakthrough yet she felt unsatisfied in her work to focus she moved to nashville where she didnt know anyone i began to ask myself who am i when everyone i know is gone  she said the answer manifested itself in the navigator  ms segarra felt   to simply mimic latin rhythms for the album ziggy stardust was a eureka moment she said referring to the intergalactic david bowie album and alter ego i learned i could create a character the navigator who would stand at the intersection of all these identities and weave in and out and i related to being the alien i began to take that as a badge of honor  for musical role models ms segarra looked to earlier latin artists heavily influenced by rock like the ghetto brothers a politically active puerto rican street gang turned band that recorded one album in  she also looked to rodriguez whom she discovered from the documentary searching for sugarman  the albums lyrics conform to rock rather than to theatrical music favoring poetic abstractions over clear narrative themes of gentrification and cultural appropriation center the work all boldly delivered by ms segarras billowing vibrato along the way she gives a nod to the young lords the puerto rican activist group of the s and s in turn ms segarra finally took full ownership of her heritage before when i heard latin sounds in popular music i thought that music belongs to everyone now i think oh thats the sound of where i came from look what we brought to the culture listen to what we added ,0,964,4389,26/7/2023,Twitter

6188,FOR SYRIAN GIRL IN NEED OF MEDICAL CARE TRUMPS TRAVEL BAN ADDS TO A NOMADIC TRAGEDY  THE NEW YORK TIMES,barcelona spain     president trumps travel ban disrupted the plans of hundreds of people around the globe but perhaps none more vulnerable than sham aldaher a syrian refugee girl and her family sham now  was born without an eye and with a seriously disfigured face following two complex operations at a barcelona hospital sham is due to receive an eye prosthesis next wednesday her family had then planned to resettle in the united states they had already completed the required interviews and cleared all security checks before the plans were blocked by  mr trumps  executive order to bar citizens from syria and six other   countries seen as threatening to americas safety they were   and they are now barred said jayne fleming the head of the human rights team at reed smith an american law firm that has been helping sham and her family ms fleming and her team are now scrambling to see whether britain germany or another country could instead welcome the family theyre distressed over not knowing what the future holds for them  the aldahers story is a nomadic tragedy telling of the accumulated hardships that have been piled on many syrian refugees it is also a small but striking example of the broader crisis highlighted in a united nations report issued on tuesday showing that the children most in need of emergency international assistance come from five of the seven countries covered by mr trumps order shams parents left syria and their jobs as teachers in  they traveled with their three children to lebanon and then egypt but their arrival coincided with the unrest and military coup that removed mohamed morsi as egypts president we left our home to find safety but in egypt there were bombings in the night and the children were very afraid said ali aldaher shams father so the family packed up again to join thousands of other syrian refugees in jordan sham was born there in july  on the day of the muslim holiday of eid   the coincidence was seen as a blessing by her parents but it complicated shams birth as most local hospital workers were on vacation and the family could not find a doctor even though a midwife eventually assisted in the birth shams mother did not receive the health care she needed and im sure all the stress hurt mr aldaher recounted when sham was born her father tried to calm his wife by pretending sham was keeping one eye shut even though he could see that she had no eyelid and a misshaped face before the birth of sham my worries were how would i support my family without any work in jordan and without money mr aldaher said after she was born we forgot about food our problems ourselves and even our other children to start our new journey of suffering for sham to see how we could possibly care for this child  shams family received assistance from different nongovernmental organizations including doctors without borders lawyers from reed smith started searching for a hospital capable of undertaking such advanced surgery while helping the family apply for resettlement in the united states the lawyers then delayed the move to america because they could not simultaneously find an american hospital ready to treat sham at no cost instead the sant joan de du hospital in barcelona agreed to help entering spain however also proved a struggle in june  the spanish government granted shams family permission to travel to barcelona shortly after the new york times published an article about the infants plight and spains refusal to grant visas to the whole family even before mr trumps executive order to bar citizens of some countries from entering the united states on security grounds many european governments were dragging their feet in meeting their own commitments to welcome more refugees following a european union agreement reached in september  by the end of  about  refugees had resettled in spain out of the quota of   agreed on by spains government sham underwent two major facial surgeries in barcelona in august doctors reset her facial bones also to make room for an eye orbit in december they fissured her skin into an eyelid and implanted fat taken from shams bottom into the artificial orbit which was then   with a curved plastic shell sham is due to receive her eye prosthesis next wednesday dr joan prat the chief ophthalmologist at the sant joan de du hospital said he used a unique technique to invent a cavity from zero  the eye surgery was not only difficult but also urgent because shams face will soon reach a level of development that would make the disfigurement permanent either we did something now or it was game over dr prat said the kind of disorder suffered by sham known as anophthalmia occurs only every few years he added the surgery was a success but dr prat said sham should remain under close monitoring not only because of her face but also because of other health concerns including her failure to put on weight further surgery will be required to correct facial asymmetries as she grows while her eye prothesis will also need replacement sham and her family were granted residency in spain until late december they have been housed in a   apartment a stones throw from the sagrada famlia barcelonas emblematic basilica ms fleming said that the family wanted to live in the united states in large part because sham could get excellent   medical care there she acknowledged that the family was now concerned about a backlash against muslims in america and that they are distressed by rhetoric that brands them as terrorists  in barcelona shams family has received support from the city as well as caritas and other nongovernmental organizations shams siblings have joined a local school on a bookshelf the family keeps a small quran that is among the few items that traveled with them from syria a prayer mat is also pinned to the wall but the family normally goes to a barcelona mosque for friday prayer when the girl was born her mother gave her an ancient name for syria sham wherever the family finally ends up living she said one day sham will ask me what is the meaning of her name and i will at least be able to tell her that it is your country it is syria ,0,1066,5068,11/5/2021,Reddit
