4101,YIKES MEGYN KELLY RECEIVES RUDE AWAKENING REMINDED SHES REPLACEABLE," comments 
megyn kelly seems to think that she can get away with anything she says or does rupert murdoch gave her a rude awakening when he told her that there are tons of other qualified people that would kill to take her spot 
rupert murdoch is making fox news salary negotiations with megyn kelly very public by granting an interview to one of the newspapers his company news corp owns the wall street journal in the interview murdoch said that keeping kelly is a priority but that he has other hosts who could take over the program should she try and go to a rival networkwe have a deep bench of talent many of whom would give their right arm for that spot said murdoch kelly who is said to be making million this year is reportedly looking to make more than million when she renegotiates her contract next july she declined a request to comment on the story 
kellys star has continued to rise over the past year and next month she will be releasing her first book settle for more it has also been revealed that kelly will be appearing live with kelly the day after the election marking the first time she is set to appear on ripas morning show as a cohost 
her popularity is one of the main reasons murdoch says he wants to get her contract signer very soon 
he added however that whether or not kelly stays at the network is up to her it is unclear where kelly might land if she does not stay with fox news but cnn seems like a very likely possibility for the popular host kelly also has a huge fan in cnn head honcho jeff zucker who called her a tremendous anchor earlier this year and former cnn president jon klein applauded kelly for not backing down to donald trump in the first republican debate when she questioned him about his treatment of women this despite the fact that her then boss roger ailes was a supporter of the republican nomineeto be able to stand up and ask tough questions to your bosss choice of president shows a certain steeliness said klein the article also points out that kelly also separated herself from other fox news anchors during the internal investigation into ailes alleged sexual harrassment by speaking with the lawyers hired to look into the claims being made by former host gretchen carlson that revelation about kellys speaking with investigators was confirmed by people who were familiar with the matter some have said that kelly is set to be the center of fox news after the exit of ailes but murdoch shot down those claims saying were not changing direction  that would be business suicide murdoch also said that he wants to make sure bill oreilly also resigns with the network when his contract is up next month one rival news executive told vanity fair in august that the rivalry between kelly and oreilly has devolved to the point that one of them will likely leave when their contracts expire oreilly shot down reports of a feud between himself and kelly in june however telling the hollywood reporter oh thats all fabricated shes in a totally different part of the building the last time i saw megyn kelly was in detroit in march at the fox news gop debate meanwhile a spokesperson for fox news said fox news president bill shine and executive vice president programming  development suzanne scott have maintained a close relationship with bill and megyn for years and have helped both of them in many instances all while coexisting under the same roof kelly has previously hinted that she would be willing to leave the network where she has worked for the last  years 
theres a lot of brain damage that comes from the job there was probably less brain damage when i worked in the afternoon i was less well known i had far less conflict in my life kelly said in an interview with variety earlier this yeari also have three kids who are soon going to be school from am to pm i come to work at  i like to see my children kelly says shes thought about hosting her own talk show but isnt sure what the market looks like for that in  and just doesnt think thats the perfect thing for me as for cohosting a morning show like today kelly said shes tried that before and shes not much of a morning personyou have to wake up so early the alarm goes off at am said kellywhen i did americas newsroom which started at am i remember saying to the makeup artist at the time if you could only know the afternoon me youd like me so much better she then added listen this is a fickle business what if they called me and fired me tomorrow i have to keep my options open

4104,TRUMP AS CYBERBULLY IN CHIEF TWITTER ATTACK ON UNION BOSS DRAWS FIRE  THE NEW YORK TIMES,washington     thirty years as a union boss in indiana have given chuck jones a thick skin but even threats to shoot him or burn his house down did not quite prepare him for becoming the target of a verbal takedown by the next president of the united states in what one republican strategist described as cyberbullying   donald j trump derided mr jones on twitter accusing him of doing a terrible job representing workers and blaming him for the decisions by companies that ship american jobs overseas the twitter message from the   at  wednesday night and a second one urging mr jones to spend more time working     less time talking continued mr trumps pattern of digital assaults most of them aimed at his political rivals reporters hollywood celebrities or female accusers on tuesday morning mr trump used twitter to assail boeing for escalating costs on the development of a new air force one but rarely has mr trump used twitter to express his ire at people like mr jones the president of united steelworkers local  who described himself on thursday as just a regular working guy  with the full power of the presidency just weeks away mr trumps decision to single out mr jones for ridicule has drawn condemnation from historians and white house veterans when you attack a man for living an ordinary life in an ordinary job it is bullying said nicolle wallace who was communications director for president george w bush and a top strategist to other republicans it is cyberbullying this is a strategy to bully somebody who dissents thats what is dark and disturbing  robert dallek a presidential historian called the verbal attack unprecedented and added its beneath the dignity of the office he doesnt seem to understand that  frank sesno a former cnn washington bureau chief and now the director of the school of media and public affairs at george washington university said mr trumps willingness to weaponize his twitter feed especially against people who are not political rivals could produce a chilling effect on people willing to publicly criticize the president anybody who goes on air or goes public and calls out the president has to then live in fear that he is going to seek retribution in the public sphere mr sesno said that could discourage people from speaking out  wednesday nights twitter message from mr trump came after mr jones on the cnn program erin burnett outfront challenged the  s claims mr jones challenged mr trumps claim to have saved   jobs in indiana at carrier corporation from being shipped overseas and said that  of those jobs were already staying in the united states as mr jones spoke a graphic flashed across cnns screens at  p m referring to something mr jones said earlier in the week carrier union boss trump lied his a off  less than  minutes after mr joness interview ended mr trumps twitter message appeared mr jones said he had just walked back into his house and hung up his coat when he got a call from a friend trumps hammering you on a tweet the friend said prompting a laugh from mr jones in the control room at cnn a planned story on immigration was scrapped and a booker went scrambling to get mr jones back on the air to respond mr trumps message to his  million twitter followers set off threats and other harassing calls to mr jones one caller left five   messages and two secretaries answering phones at the locals headquarters have been similarly swamped its riled the people up mr jones said a lot of the people who have called and been not very nice to me they have been quite clear that they are trump supporters and im an ungrateful     mr jones refused on thursday to back down from his criticism of mr trump and he shrugged off mr trumps claim that he had not done enough to help the workers his union represents hell i know what i did for the last  years mr jones said noting his work on behalf of pensions and salaries that average  per hour but mr jones also said that he and the   have been on the same side when it comes to trying to protect the livelihoods of   workers he said he would happily collaborate with mr trump to try to save the  carrier jobs still scheduled to be moved to mexico if he in fact called today and said lets get together to save the  jobs id be glad to do anything i possibly could to work with him in any fashion mr jones said i dont foresee that happening  veterans of the white house say they do not know what to expect from mr trump whose actions since the election have broken with many presidential norms david axelrod who was a senior adviser to president obama said he always advised the current occupant of the oval office to be mindful of the extra power that his words carried once they were amplified by the most powerful megaphone in the world what you may think is a light tap is a howitzer mr axelrod said when you have the man in the most powerful office for whom there is no target too small that is a chilling prospect he has the ability to destroy people in  characters  throughout the campaign mr trump dashed off twitter messages in response to what he saw on television sometimes calling out specific television personalities like megyn kelly or joe scarborough by name mr trump has not stopped since he won the election when he abruptly took to twitter on nov  to attack those who burn the american flag it happened shortly after a fox  friends segment about a   incident in recent weeks mr trump retweeted several people who were bashing the cnn reporter jeff zeleny and he has been critical of saturday night live and the shows trump impersonator alec baldwin whether mr trump will continue to use twitter as president is unclear though few people inside or outside mr trumps orbit believe he will give up his digital connection to millions of followers two spokesmen for mr trump did not respond to emails seeking comment on his twitter message about mr jones if he continues to tweet mr trump may discover that his words carry new weight and are given new meaning when they come from the white house ms wallace said he may end up having meetings with world leaders that do not go well and be tempted to tweet his disapproval its irrevocable what you put out in a tweet its not like you can take it back ms wallace said but she added that she does not expect mr trump to change his behavior once he is inaugurated there can be a transformation when you get into the office but its usually on policy not behavior she said im not sure that the office will change his nature ,0,1161,5290,7/4/2019,The Guardian

4113,WHAT WIKILEAKS HACK SAYS ABOUT CLINTON OUR VIEW,"now we know why she didnt want those wall street speeches made public

the stream of hacked wikileaks emails  the latest trove dumped thursday  from inside hillary clintons campaign opens up a troubling prospect far beyond their revelations about the differing public and private faces of the democratic presidential nominee

the leaks show that the russian government might be trying to interfere with the us presidential race aiming cyberattacks at the very heart of american democracy its fair and open elections if an fbi investigation proves that to be the case the hacked emails represent an electronic version of watergate the  burglary of democratic national headquarters that ultimately forced richard nixon from the white house only this time the threat comes from a foreign adversary rather than a presidential administration

for now though most of the public attention is on the content of the emails themselves which make clear why clinton balked at releasing transcripts of the highdollar speeches she delivered to audiences on wall street and elsewhere in  and 

assuming the wikileaks emails are accurate clinton portrayed herself to bankers as more supportive of free trade and more flexible on industry regulation than she has been during her drive for the presidency

sounding like an ardent freetrader in a  speech clinton told one group of bankers my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade this was consistent with her stance as secretary of state in  when she praised the proposed transpacific partnership tpp as the gold standard of free trade agreements

by  however clinton faced populist challenges first from bernie sanders and then from donald trump she now opposes the tpp and has few good things to say about free trade

these days she also proclaims her disdain for income inequality and wall street having asserted in february that wall street can never be allowed to once again threaten main street and i will fight to rein in wall street

that was not her tone three years ago when she told new yorks goldman sachs that the industry needs to be a part of fashioning industry regulation and commiserated with the investment bankers over the bias against people who have led successful andor complicated lives

true many politicians change positions  none more so than trump  and some say things in private they never want the public to hear but they pay a price for duplicity when they fail to come clean and the comments ultimately do become public

clinton had two ways to inoculate herself against any damaging leaks from her wall street speeches one is that she could have released the transcripts months ago inconvenient as that might have been the other is that she could have turned down the speaking engagements in the first place

as the purported champion of the middle class clinton might have thought twice before taking   what it takes a typical american household four years to earn  for an hour or so of work from an industry that helped push the economy to nearcollapse and forced millions of americans into foreclosure

now amid the steady drip of embarrassing private emails the speeches have come back to bite her the wounds would have gone deeper if disclosures of trumps lewd sexual comments and alleged assaults had not overshadowed them

for clinton and other politicians the lesson is if you fear something will become public dont do it or at the very least disclose it yourself rather than let others control the story

for american voters the lesson is to beware of foreign governments seeking to damage democracy that harm if confirmed will last far longer than memories about the content of particular emails hacked from clintons campaign manager

4116,DEUTSCHE BANK TROUBLES RAISE FEAR OF GLOBAL SHOCK  THE NEW YORK TIMES,london     germanys largest bank appears in danger sending stock markets worldwide on a wild ride yet the biggest source of worry is less about its finances than a vast tangle of unknowns     not least whether europe can muster the will to mount a rescue in the event of an emergency in short fears that europe lacks the cohesion to avoid a financial crisis may be enhancing the threat of one the immediate source of alarm is the health of deutsche bank whose vast and sprawling operations are entangled with the fates of investment houses from tokyo to london to new york deutsche is staring at a   fine from the justice department for its enthusiastic participation in wall streets festival of toxic mortgage products in the years leading up to financial crisis of  given deutsches myriad other troubles     a role in the manipulation of a financial benchmark claims of trades that violated russian sanctions and a generalized sense of confusion about its mission     the american pursuit of a stiff penalty comes at an inopportune time it heightens the sense that deutsche     whose shares have lost more than half their value this year     needs to secure additional investment lest it leave itself vulnerable to some new crisis the biggest worries center on what happens if deutsche falls apart to the point that it threatens the globe with a financial shock     and whether new rules and buffers put in place since the last crisis will keep the pain from spreading regulations that took effect this year in the european union standardize how member countries are supposed to handle the potential implosion of a large financial institution banks too have put aside more money to deal with potential losses deutsche could pose the first test of the new arrangement recent challenges have underscored concerns about the limits of solidarity in europe from the chaos of the sovereign debt crisis to the acrimony over an influx of refugees european authorities have proved something less than an exemplar of coordinated government action the european union has become a focus of populist anger further constraining options and germany has opposed bailouts for lenders in other lands making a deutsche rescue politically radioactive all of which adds to worries that deutsche amounts to a fire burning one that might yet become an inferno while the fire department is consumed with existential arguments over its purpose if the alarm sounds no one can be sure what if anything will happen in the worst case     now highly unlikely     the bank could collapse inciting a scramble to pull money from markets around the globe institutions that trade with deutsche would feel an urge to collect their cash immediately given the scale of the banks balance sheet       trillion euros or more than  trillion     that inclination is likely to spread to every crevice of finance economies would grind to a halt jobs and fortunes would disappear despite murmurings in pundit quarters that this sort of situation may be unfolding provoking comparisons with the catastrophic bankruptcy of the american investment banking giant lehman brothers eight years ago most economists dismiss such talk as overwrought and overblown deutsche is sitting on cash reserves worth  billion or about  billion it has sold bonds that can be converted to equity should the need arise the justice departments proposed fine of  billion is viewed as the opening of a negotiation that could cost deutsche a fraction of that amount     thinking that sent the stock surging on friday not least deutsche bank is a classic example of the species of financial animal known as too big to fail we saw what happened with lehman said nicola borri a finance professor at luiss a university in rome its impossible that the authorities would let something like that happen again it has ties with all the banks in the world it is highly leveraged a disorderly default would be very very difficult for the entire financial system  on both sides of the atlantic the financial crisis prompted the construction of new regulatory authorities and requirements that banks set aside more funds in reserve against troubles the system is much more robust and resilient because of the buffers said nicolas vron a senior fellow at bruegel a research institution in brussels there are pockets of fragility but broadly speaking the system is better prepared  but the markets do not appear to fully buy that the defenses are secure deutsche is heavily involved in the trading of derivatives the exotic financial instruments that were at the center of the  crisis derivatives can be so   complex that no one fully grasps who owes what to whom until someone big enough to rattle markets suddenly cannot pay then fear takes over and investors dump holdings indiscriminately this lowers the value of even solid assets on bank balance sheets giving rise to further cause for concern because deutsche has been dominated by its investment banking operations     meaning it is not sitting on a large pile of plain deposits as a cushion     it is especially vulnerable to such volatility fear in other words is not just a symptom of trouble but also a cause this makes deutsches problems the worlds problems not for nothing did the international monetary fund in june declare deutsche to be the most important net contributor to systemic risks on earth a collapse may be exceedingly unlikely yet the beginning would probably feel something like recent days thursday brought reports that hedge funds were quietly extracting their money from deutsches coffers the banks shares plummeted to a new low friday morning deutsches chief executive officer john cryan released a letter to his staff offering assurances that the bank boasted strong fundamentals  the stock recovered slightly on those comments but the sense remained that the need for reassurance attested to concerns the biggest form of insurance against panic is confidence that larger players     in this case european authorities     stand at the ready to mount a rescue should one be required but confidence is not something europe has proved terribly skilled at instilling its abilities to marshal a bailout are dubious new rules introduced to discourage reckless investments by large financial institutions bar   bailouts germany has been adamant that these strictures be applied rebuffing a recent attempt by the italian prime minister matteo renzi to secure an exemption allowing him to inject taxpayer money into the italian banking system the optics of germany seeking a way around the rules for its largest lender would be especially problematic the deutsche chief and the german government both shot down a report that the bank had asked that a bailout be prepared more broadly germany has been the most fervent voice that reckless economic pursuits should be punished no matter the human toll as athens has negotiated with european authorities and the international monetary fund for a series of bailouts germany has demanded deep cuts to greek public spending sharply cutting pension payments to retirees the greek government used much of the bailout money to pay back debts to german banks against this backdrop a german bailout of its largest bank would reinvigorate accusations that it uses the european union as a cover to pursue its own national interests this dynamic has force in the markets presenting another factor that investors must absorb as the evaluate they risks of holding deutsches debts and shares the fact that we dont know the reaction of the authorities is a factor of uncertainty said mr veron of bruegel here is a feedback loop that amplifies the risks the likelihood that deutsche needs a rescue appears small yet the possibility that a rescue could be forged seems close to nil that tightens the pressure on deutsche and yet deutsches stature may provide the decisive form of insurance in event of emergency the authorities might have to act whatever the politics deutsche bank is so big and so systemically important that the rules will be bent mr borri said if i were an investor i would assume that the rules would be bent ,0,1340,6728,11/2/2022,TikTok

4118,RUSSIA IS STOCKPILING GOLD AT AN ALARMING RATE  WILL THE NEXT WORLD WAR BE FOUGHT WITH CURRENCIES,wed  oct   utc with all eyes on russias unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile icbm which nato has dubbed the satan missile  as tensions with the us increase moscows most potent weapon may be something drastically different the rapidly evolving geopolitical weapon brandished by russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold as well as russias native currency the ruble take a look at the symbol below as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order  potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift  and much sooner than you might think the symbol is the new designation of the russian ruble russias national currency similar to how the us uses the dollar sign  the uk uses the pound sign  and the european union uses the euro symbol  russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationally after the failed reset in usrussian relations by the obama administration and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship washington began targeting entire sectors of the russian economy as well as specific individuals meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force moscow into compliance instead of decimating russia what it precipitated was a russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the us petrodollar and working with china to create an alternative to the swift payment system that isnt solely controlled by western interests see asian infrastructure investment bank  new development bank according to the corbett report  new reports indicate that china is ready to launch its swift alternative and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of dedollarization that is seeing the bricsled resistance bloc breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the usled washington consensus for those who dont know swift stands for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication and is shorthand for the swiftnet network that is used by over  financial institutions in  countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world swift does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions still given the systems near universality in the financial system it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the swift network this is why delisting from the swift network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the us and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaigns recently financial guru jim rickards author of the book  currency wars  wrote that russia is poised for a major comeback in its economy russian bonds and stocks and the russian currency the ruble will all benefit rickards believes a strong turnaround is coming within russia and that this comeback will benefit the ruble while still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the us russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar there remains a clear and present danger of the russian economy being devastated by the whims of washington the bank of russia that nations central bank is extremely clear about its mission and monetary policy declaring on its website monetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing wellbeing of russian citizens the bank of russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflationtargeting regime and sees price stability albeit sustainably low inflation as its priority given structural peculiarities of the russian economy the target is to reduce inflation to  by  and maintain it within that range in the medium run in laymans terms that means that monetary policy similar to nuclear weapons and the military are an integral part of the state policy in russia while many analysts have noted the increased buildup in russias military arsenal seemingly few have highlighted the massive buildup of russian gold reserves over the past decade below is a chart showing russian gold reserves between  and last year  since  there has been a yearonyear increase that reveals a significant upward trend the chart clearly reveals that russias state policy of increasing state monetary assets in the form of gold additionally the russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets from  to  russias state holdings of gold tripled within just the past year russia has substantially increased its gold holdings according to the business insider  in july of this year the central bank of russia added  ounces of gold to its reserves the onemonth uptick in russian gold reserves   ounces  is approximately equal to the entire annual output of barrick golds turquoise ridge gold mine in nevada at that same rate   ounces per month  in a mere five months russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of barricks massive goldstrike mine in nevada  currently russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world its clear that there is a concerted effort by russian authorities to build up the countrys gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the united states rickards in his  book  currency wars  theorized that russia and china could combine their gold reserves to form a global goldbacked currency to compete against the us dollar currently russian reserves stand at roughly  tonnes with chinese reserves totaling over  tonnes according to china  its likely more which would amount to a combined total of roughly  tonnes of gold the us is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the international monetary fund imf thus the us lockup on global gold is about to vanish according to business insider imagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that russianchinese alliance could exercise indirect or even direct control over the imfs gold reserve of over  tonnes russian chinese and imf gold combined would equal roughly  tonnes and would allow for direct competition with the us gold reserves estimated at  tonnes russia and china have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by washington as its weapon of choice when opposing a wellarmed state and clearly see the writing on the wall  thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm the reality is that the united states is  trillion dollars in debt and eventually the time will come when the us economy begins to implode  and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper its printed on hard assets such as gold and silver should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the us using the petrodollar as a weapon ultimately the united states russia and china are all controlled by centralized powerhungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the imf the world bank swift new development bank and the asian infrastructure investment bank its not russian nuclear weapons that people should fear as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a firststrike nuclear attack the true threat to america is our economic house of cards built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the rights of corporations over that of people

4127, EVAN MCMULLIN NEVER IN HIS LIFE HAS TRUMP HAD TO WATCH HIS MOUTH VIDEO,donald trump s mouth gets him into trouble a lot there have been endless examples of his inability to curb what he says which in and of itself means that he is disqualified from the presidency there are many rightwingers who are so terrified of trump that they are backing democratic nominee hillary clinton and while others won t vote for clinton they won t vote for trump eitherwell now conservatives have another option former cia operative evan mcmullin while he has never held public office mcmullin is certainly a sight better than trump his candidacy at this late stage of the  race is most likely just a way to stop trump after all he entered the race far too late to gain any real traction and independent bids for the presidency in america always fail spectacularly however thanks to the outrageous nature of trump s candidacy mcmullin is definitely shaking things upappearing on abc s this week mcmullin had quite a few choice words for trump he said he s not a credible candidate it s clear the numbers the fact that donald trump can t control what he says he s never had to control what he said never in life has he had to do that it s unrealistic to expect him to do that now mcmullin went on to make the case for voters to consider him instead of one of the two major party candidates we need someone who will bring this country together i firmly believe that the time has come in this country for a new generation of leadership and that certainly is not donald trump nor democratic nominee hillary clinton clearly i disagree with the guy regarding hillary clinton she is easily the most qualified person to ever run for the office of the presidency but mcmullin is definitely right about trump there s no way in hell that guy should be anywhere near the nukes all mcmullin s candidacy would do is help further shift things in clinton s direction and that is aok with mewatch mcmullin s remarks belowevanmcmullin trumps never had to control what he says its unrealistic to expect him to do that now httpstcohfwtipadk  this week thisweekabc august  featured image via video screen capture,1,377,1723,9/10/2021,The Guardian

4133,US JUDGE UNLIKELY TO REMOVE BLOCK ON TRUMP SANCTUARY CITY ORDER,san francisco reuters  a us judge on wednesday said he was very much inclined to maintain a court order that blocks president donald trumps administration from carrying out a policy designed to threaten federal funds to socalled sanctuary cities at a hearing in san francisco federal court us district judge william orrick iii said a recent memo from the justice department that appeared to narrow the scope of trumps executive order on sanctuary cities did not remove the need for an injunction trump issued the order in january directing that funding be slashed to all jurisdictions that refuse to comply with a statute that requires local governments to share information with immigration authorities sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to enforce of federal immigration laws dozens of local governments and cities including new york los angeles and chicago have joined the growing sanctuary movement the trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes the republican presidents moves to crack down on immigration have galvanized legal advocacy groups along with democratic city and state governments to oppose them in court  after trump issued the sanctuary cities executive order earlier this year santa clara county  which includes the city of san jose and several smaller silicon valley communities  sued saying it was unconstitutional san francisco filed a similar lawsuit in a ruling in april orrick said trumps order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional attorney general jeff sessions then issued a memo which formally endorsed a narrower interpretation of trumps order saying that the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs in court on wednesday deputy assistant attorney general brett shumate said the sessions memo meant less than a million dollars were now at risk for santa clara county and san francisco so the injunction was no longer needed but orrick said an injunction was still necessary because trump could always order sessions to issue new broader guidance the attorney general still has the ability to change that memo orrick said the judge said he would also likely reject a justice department request to dismiss other claims by santa clara and san francisco       ,0,402,2165,16/7/2023,Al Jazeera

4136,RUSSIA IS QUIETLY WINNING THE MIDDLE EAST  AND NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT  JAMES HOLBROOKS,"originally appeared at anti media 
as fighting resumes in aleppo following a brief ceasefire  and as russias largest naval fleet to sail since the cold war steams down the english channel on its way to the western coast of syria  its important in times when most of the focus is being drawn to one point to step back and look at the whole board 
yes whats happening in aleppo is a tragedy civilians women and children are being blasted out of existence as two superpowers back opposing sides in a proxy war for regional dominance yes as the russian fleet nears the mediterranean sea tensions will undoubtedly escalate for a number of nations with ties to the syrian conflict 
but president vladimir putins moves regarding aleppo are far from his only ones worth noting of late 
take turkey for instance last week underground reporter posited the idea that turkey due to its deteriorating relations with the united states and its strengthening cooperation with russia has in effect become the military wild card in the middle east cited as evidence of deepening russianturkish ties was the fact that the two countries have just signed a deal to build a pipeline from turkey to ukraine which would then supply natural gas to europe 
turkey which is north of syria shares much of its southern and all of its eastern border with the mediterranean sea a good portion of syrias western border also runs into the mediterranean and its in those waters where russian vessels already hovering there await the arrival of the aircraft carrierled fleet now pushing through the english channel 
all this fits nicely into a narrative that only focuses on whats happening in aleppo but one need only glance at a map to see using nothing but the eyes and common sense just how much more is actually taking place right now 
in midoctober it was reported that for the first time ever russia and egypt would conduct joint military drills this followed news that russia will sell attack helicopters to the north african nation and invest billions in egyptian infrastructure these items along with the fact that egypt is eager to be regranted russian tourism rights for its citizens after recent bad blood between the countries lead one to the logical conclusion that egypt has every incentive to cooperate with russia going forward 
egypt in case youre not looking at that map is directly across the mediterranean sea from turkey 
this means when the russian fleet reaches the mediterranean  whether the intent is to park in those waters and bombard aleppo as some believe or merely to project russian might to the world as others suggest  it will be flanked by friendlies on three sides turkey to the north syrian to the east and egypt to the south 
this is not a bad position to be in if youre looking to build a natural gas pipeline from turkey to ukraine turkey incidentally shares its northern border with the black sea which in turn shares its southern border with ukraine and the black sea as those whove followed the ukrainian situation in recent years well know is swarming with russian warships 
so in the bigger picture  assuming turkey will eventually fully embrace the russian sphere and that egypt as its highly incentivized to do embraces its new role as a russian satellite  putin has protected himself quite deftly from those in the west wholl inevitably no matter what the fleet does once it arrives accuse putin of aggression 
turkey and egypt are both formerly staunch us allies after all and theres been no official severing of ties or even hintsof such with those nations so putin thanks largely to the wests own hegemonic maneuvering has a lot of room to operate in terms of deals and cooperation  both militarily and economically 
in any case the facts present a narrative  albeit a theoretical one  that isnt being discussed putin as we speak may be implementing the first phases of an effort to secure a nice straight shot from turkey to ukraine for the longdesired turkish stream pipeline did you enjoy this article  consider helping us russia insider depends on your donations the more you give the more we can do   other amount

4137,TOM HAYDEN ON THE VIETNAM WAR AND AMERICAS COLLECTIVE MEMORY,"tom hayden on the vietnam war and americas collective memory posted on oct   
tom hayden was a crucial figure in the student activist movements of the s and s known for participating in antiwar protests and demonstrating for civil rights notably he demonstrated against the vietnam war and was even arrested for his antiwar efforts hayden died on sunday at the age of  but even in the last few years he continued to remind america of the importance of activism 
in a speech given last year at vietnam the power of protest a conference in washington dc hayden cited his activist history and urged americans not to forget the powerful political movements of earlier decades the struggle for memory and for history is a living thing he told the audience each generation has to wrestle with the history of what came before and ask whose interest does this history serve how does it advance a legacy of social movements how does it deny that legacy 
hayden then began to explain the importance of remembering the widespread political activism of the s and s we gather here to remember the power that we had at one point the power of the peace movement and to challenge the pentagon now on the battlefield of memory he said he continued 
there came a generation of career politicians who were afraid of association with the peace movement who were afraid of being seen as soft who saw that the inside track was the track of war our national forgetting is basically pathological our systemspolitics media cultureare totally out of balance today because of our collective refusal to admit that the vietnam war was wrong and that the peace movement was right in the absencein the absence of an established voice for peace in all the institutions the neoconservatives will fill the foreign policy vacuum am i right will it not will it not advise both parties i think though that american public opinion has shifted to a much more skeptical state of mind than earlier generations but the spectrum of american politics and media has not 
in order to fully unify hayden concluded america must remember its past although he noted the many successes of the antiwar and procivil rights movements he argues that activists must accept that they all walked away when the vietnam war ended we might have been united hayden said but instead we were relegated to wondering what might have been

4139,COMMENT ON ARMED MILITIAS PREPPING FOR VIOLENCE IF CLINTON WINS IN STOLEN ELECTION BY JOEL W,"home  be the change  armed militias prepping for violence if clinton wins in stolen election armed militias prepping for violence if clinton wins in stolen election matt agorist november    comments 
as the insane circus act that is the  election cycle comes to a head americans are playing right into the establishments plan of divide so that they can be conquered  is proving to be the year that america has lost its collective mind 
on november th americans will go to the polls and decide to cast their vote for a megalomaniacal flipflopping establishment cozying crony or a murderous war criminal controlled by soros and rothschild 
having failed to effectively support a third party candidate america once again will be forced to choose between the lesser of two evils 
while peaceful militias are certainly healthy for protecting the citizens from the violence of a rogue state a report out of reuters shows that militias are now preparing to act if their statist doesnt win 
as reuters reports  camouflaged members of the three percent security force have mobilized for rifle practice handtohand combat training  and an impromptu campaign rally for republican presidential candidate donald trump 
a wellregulated militia is supposed to protect people from the state  not fight for a political candidate 
this is the last chance to save america from ruin chris hill a paralegal who goes by the code name bloodagent told reuters im surprised i was able to survive or suffer through eight years of obama without literally going insane but hillary is going to be more of the same 
while the latter part of that statement is correct hill is missing the target widely if he thinks trump will change anything as ron paul said when alex jones attempted to trick him into supporting trump donald trump would be the champion of the executive order 
how many people are voting for trump oohrah asks hill 
oohrah shouts back a dozen militia members 
as the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on nov  and civil unrest in the days following a victory by democrat hillary clinton reports reuters 
hillary clinton would likely attempt to disarm americans if she is elected but donald trump is certainly no champion of the second amendment either as he and clinton both agree on the illegal and due processremoving notion of banning people on the terror watch list from buying guns 
no one is advocating that terrorists should have guns but using an arbitrary list that people have no way of disputing to strip them of their rights is not only inefficient but it is against the constitution where are the constitutionalists on this call by trump 
i will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen and prevent them from being disarmed and i will fight and i will kill and i may die in the process said hill as he conveniently ignores trumps antisecond amendment stance 
protecting his fellow countrymen from a government who wishes to disarm them is most certainly an honorable stance however this stance should be universally applied and uncompromised  even if it means not supporting donald trump 
if trump loses im grabbing my musket former illinois representative joe walsh wrote on twitter last week but if trump wins walsh could be stripped of his second amendment with no due process when he gets put on a terror watch list  kevinbuist if a person is a suspected terrorist then charge him and present evidence potential is punished only in dystopian novels 
 justin amash justinamash june   
weve been building up for this just like the marines said hill we are going to really train harder and try to increase our operational capabilities in the event that this is the day that we hoped would never come 
unfortunately as long as people are willing to compromise on their principles to fight for the lesser of two evils that day will most certainly come and trump will do nothing to stop it 
the good news is the three percenters seem to have the interests of the people in mind and hill vowed to protect those who want to exercise their first amendment by marching on washington to protest in the event of a rigged election 
as weve already pointed out clintons only chance of winning is doing exactly that  rigging the election 
beginning in iowa and eventually getting blown wide open in arizona the fraud and suppression of votes have already let americans know that their rulers are selected not elected 
examples of this fraud were captured on video documented on paper and even broadcast live on television 
a rigged election is almost a certainty and should most definitely be resisted however as long as americans continue to buy into the political shitshow that is the twoparty paradigm it will only continue to get worse  no matter the puppets in white marble buildings matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world follow mattagorist on twitter and now on steemit share google  joel w

mass of humanity with the intent to cause havoc and now it has begunof course regardless of whether syrian refugees are allowed in or not tashfeen malik and syed farook would have committed the san bernardino shooting farook was born an american and malik was a pakistani with a k visa essentially a mailorder bridefianc e visas were bad enough when it was just war brides and gold diggers from the formersoviet union countries but now these bitches are trying to kill peoplethe isis claim of responsibility for the san bernardino shooting is definitely iffy terrorists aren t known for being the most honest sorts and would claim a tornado tearing through an oklahoma trailer park as their doing if they could find the sooner state on a mapi imagine the state department will exercise the same sort of diligence and care in vetting all the syrian refugees as was giving to tashfeen malik we only have every person who ever came into contact with her saying malik was a hardcore ideologue with jihad tendencies attending alhuda international seminary wasn t a tip that she might not be terribly friendly to the united statesalhuda is basically postgraduate school for those who hate the great satan america oh by the way there are campuses in the united states and canada and they offer convenient internet classes for those who would like to learn jihad from the comfort of their own homesneither the saudis nor the pakistanis want to claim this chick both are pointing at the other and saying  she went rogue on your watch  that s saying a lot for two countries that are absolutely lousy with terrorists and terrorism to the point it is at least their number two exportas the investigation deepens it s coming out that these two were jihadis long before isis came to anyone s attention in the aftermath there is a litany of friends and family associates and acquaintances who had distanced themselves from the muslim bonnie and clyde and did absolutely nothing to tip off the rest of the world that farook and malik were becoming dangerousin the weeks and months to come i predict a long line of people who knew what was going on not just the neighbors who harbored strong suspicions but didn t say anything because they were scared to death of the liberal social justice warriors letting slip the social media dogs of war against them for being islamophobes racists and all around bigotswhat i m talking about are fellow muslims who knew damn well they were killersinwaitingas i write this the fbi is putting together enough evidence to arrest farook s father no doubt his mother will be occupying a jail cell in short order too regardless one s opinion on laws imposing the duty to report certain crimes being arrested for failure to report a pending terror attack tells me there is probable cause to believe they possessed the informationjust where is this vast majority of muslims who abhor what syed farook and tashfeen malik did in san bernardino you know the ones who supposedly love america and her freedomsa few representatives of mosques and lawyers for the family have been condemning their act in the week since the shooting spree but what about the rankandfile sorts who actually knew them neither was on any sort of watch list or under investigation the government had no reason to be keeping tabs on them yet the very people who were in positions to point them out did nothingto say  not all muslims are terrorists  is like saying  not all fords explode  a true statement on its face but losing sight of the fact that an identifiable subgroup of fords exploded under the right circumstancesreaders who remember voting for ronald reagan at least once probably also remember the fuel tank controversy involving the ford pinto if you don t google it out because i m not your history professor and you won t understand what i m about to saythere were about  million pintos in the united states when ford initiated their recall in the fall of  eventually  deaths that would not have otherwise occurred were attributed to fires subsequent to lowspeed rearend collisions every model of ford since has borne the stigma of the fiery ford i know a guy who still says he drives a  ford exploder not all fords explode not all ford pintos explode not all ford pintos of an identifiable body type explode it specifically requires addition of a lowspeed rearending that also breaches the integrity of the gas tank along with a spark to ignite the whole mess and it helps for the body panels to crumple in just the right way to prevent the doors from opening and trapping the occupants insideso tell me again why we are unable to pick out the dangerous muslimsas coincidence would have it there are about  million muslims in the united states with fourteen dead and twentyone wounded just last week in san bernardino is twentyseven dead bodies the magic number before somebody says  you know there seems to be an awful lot of people dying when muslims are around maybe we should stop letting them come here until we get a handle on this problem via carlos cunha,1,1041,4918,4/8/2021,Facebook

4149,TRUMPS WOMEN PROBLEM,"cnn the thing about women donald j trump once wrote is that they have one of the great acts of all time

the smart ones act very feminine and needy but inside they are real killers he continued the person who came up with the expression the weaker sex was either very nave or had to be kidding i have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye  or perhaps another body part

the provocative passage along with several others is contained in a chapter devoted to women in trumps  book the art of the comeback

his words on women have newfound relevance in  as trumps enigmatic relationship with the opposite sex is front and center in his campaign for president

the comments play on potential vulnerabilities for his likely general election opponent  but they also highlight trumps own significant hurdles with female voters as he tries to win their votes in november

he went on to connect clinton with her husbands marital indiscretions

in a testy exchange he told cuomo he raised the issue as retribution for clinton playing the womans card to the hilt in the campaign

trump raised that notion last week during his victory speech in new york suggesting her appeal to female voters based solely on gender was her only asset

shes got nothing else going on he said

the intense scrutiny of the campaign has also renewed interest in trumps crude banter about his sexual conquests and desires on howard sterns radio show

his controversial remarks then and during the  campaign have taken a toll on his image among female voters

the women standing by him

but for all the women who have voiced their collective disapproval in polling numbers those closest to the billionaire businessman insist hes a model husband and father  supportive nurturing and empowering

some women who have worked for trump offer a similar assessment despite his controversial public comments he is a giving and inspirational boss they say and treats female employees no differently than their male counterparts

still it is difficult to paint a full portrait of trumps dealings with women because many who have worked with him over the years have no interest in talking publicly about a candidate who has shown no hesitation in striking back at his critics

a number of trumps former female colleagues contacted by cnn did not return calls some refused to talk on the record one prominent former trump colleague hung up abruptly on a reporter explaining that she had no interest in being hounded by the press

hence the lingering question whats the deal with donald trump and women

the perception that trump has a problem with females stems in part from highprofile clashes over the years in which hes called them names and ridiculed their appearance

trump has said he loves women finds them beautiful and is not a sexist

twice divorced by the time the book was published trumps views on women were shaped by what he saw as the aggressive behavior of females around him

he wrote of a married socialite who propositioned him on a ballroom dance floor as her husband looked on and about a bridetobe jumping on top of me wanting to get screwed in his limousine a week before she was due to be married

the level of aggression was unbelievable he wrote of the dance floor incident this is not infrequent it happens all the time

their sex drive makes us look like babies he wrote of women at another point in the same book

living up to his mother

trump opened the chapter on women by writing that part of the problem he has with them is having to compare them to my incredible mother mary trump

he recalled his mom as smart as hell and as a really great homemaker and wife to my father

he came to see his mothers supporting role as a model not just for his own situation but for any man who wants to succeed

for a man to be successful he needs support at home just like my father had from my mother not someone who is always griping and bitching he wrote when a man has to endure a woman who is not supportive and complains constantly about his not being home enough or not being attentive enough he will not be very successful unless he is able to cut the cord

the passage did not explore the possibility of a woman as the familys primary wageearner

trump wrote that his big mistake with his first wife ivana was taking her out of the role of wife and allowing her to run one of my casinos in atlantic city then the plaza hotel

she did an excellent job at both he wrote but once she took on those roles work was all she wanted to talk about

i will never again give a wife responsibility within my business trump wrote ivana worked very hard and i appreciate the effort but i soon began to realize that i was married to a business person rather than a wife

on the campaign trail in  trump has said his wife melania would make a great first lady

melania trump a former model who has designed her own jewelry line for qvc has emerged as an important advocate for her husband driving the argument that he treats everyone equally

she has spoken about the importance of her career but described herself in an interview with parenting magazine as a fulltime mom to her son barron that is my first job

melania has tried to explain the paradox of trump and women by saying that when her husband is attacked he will attack back no matter who you are

he encourages everybody if youre a man or a woman she said during an april  trump family cnn town hall

his daughter ivanka a successful businesswoman in her own right said during the cnn town hall that he taught her that there wasnt anything that i couldnt do if i set my mind to it she also praised him for hiring incredible female role models in the highest executive positions at the trump organization

but trump has repeatedly stumbled into controversy with his asides about women over the past year and his approval numbers among women have spiraled downward

the republican party was already facing a deficit among women voters in  barack obama led mitt romney among female voters by about  points  with a particularly steep deficit among single women romney beat obama by  points among married women who have generally viewed the gop more favorably

in a march quinnipiac university poll  of women said they would not vote for trump in a general election  a reflection of his poor approval ratings among women in a wide variety of national polls

his campaign manager corey lewandowski predicted trumps image among women would improve as the campaign progressed his aides have pointed out that he trounced his rivals among republican women in recent gop primaries including pennsylvania maryland and connecticut though that is hardly a good measure of how he would fare in a general election

donald trumps numbers are going to be strong with women because they want the same thing that everybody else wants lewandowski said in a telephone interview

they dont vote based on gender they vote on competency  and that competency includes making sure that the nation is secure which donald trump has pledged he will do making sure we dont have illegal immigrants pouring across the border and making sure individuals have opportunities for jobs

those are the things that cut across socioeconomic status they cut across gender they cut across race

beyond focusing on those broad themes however trump has done little to try to shore up his weaknesses among women voters

his various stumbles havent helped he angered both abortionrights supporters and opponents for example when he said during an msnbc town hall that women who have abortions should be punished if the procedure is outlawedand then quickly reversed himself

his personal critiques of womens looks on the campaign trail have been pointed

when an antitrump super pac cut an ad that used a revealing photo of melania from her days as a super model trump blamed cruz be careful lyin ted or i will spill the beans on your wife he tweeted

he offended some female voters when he retweeted an unflattering picture of heidi cruz a goldman sachs executive next to melania a picture is worth a thousand words the caption said

angered by the tweets cruz warned his thenadversary to leave heidi the hell alone and told reporters strong women scare donald

trump insisted the press stirred up the controversy the media is so after me on women the real estate magnate tweeted on march  wow this is a tough business nobody has more respect for women than donald trump

but female voters seem increasingly skeptical as trump prepares to take on hillary clinton who is running to be the first female president

some women who have worked for trump say they find it difficult to reconcile some of his statements and written opinions with the way he treated them

jill cremer worked as a vice president overseeing real estate development at the trump organization for a decade beginning in 

she said it was a hard decision to leave and she only learned after working elsewhere just how good shed had it

he was a fantastic employer said cremer still a realestate executive in manhattan i dont have one bad thing to say about him

she said trump ran the office as a meritocracy and was refreshingly unconcerned about educational pedigrees

though she went to work for trump at the relatively young age of  she said he put her on projects that challenged her and forced her to grow

hed say i believe in you im gonna give you this  now go run with it cremer recalled

and i did it she said

cremer said trump has made some cringeworthy public comments involving women over the years but she said he never talked that way to her or in her presence

i dont know how to explain it she said but when youre on the inside its different

lili amini who manages trumps golf club in palos verdes offered a similar description of her billionaire boss

amini who was identified by a trump campaign aide as a female employee who could talk about his management style said she met trump in  when she accompanied her father to work at the sprawling resort overlooking the pacific ocean her parents owned a flower business and maintained the plants and flowers at the trump facility

she was  at the time and studying to be a buyer in the fashion world

she said trump walked up and asked her father whos this

he introduced his daughter and the two struck up a conversation by the end of it amini recalled trump told her i want you to work here

she said she didnt know anything about running a food and beverage operation at the time and didnt even know what job she was being offered but after discussing the offer with her parents she decided it was too good to pass up

she started out as the small events coordinator and with trumps mentoring and support has worked her way to general manager

she said trump would periodically show up at the resort and each time he did would encourage her to learn everything she could about some new aspect of the business

he was always encouraging she said and always professional he taught her she said to never doubt herself hes been a great motivator she said impossible is never a word that i use in my vocabulary

amini said trump never made her feel like she got the job because she was a woman or that she was being secondguessed based on her gender after she rose through the ranks

its just about the work she said its always about the work

trump received more mixed reviews from barbara res who worked for trump from  to  and helped oversee the construction of trump tower on fifth avenue

res said she had good working relationship with trump and that it was an unusual move for him to hire her in  because there were so few women working in the construction industry

but res who wrote about her experiences in her book all alone on the th floor how one woman changed the face of construction said trump became less approachable and accessible over time

in an essay for the new york daily news res wrote that trump was nasty to the people who work for him that he could be very abusive and curt and had an incredible temper  he lashes out at everyone

of all the people i know who worked for or with trump including contractors lawyers architects employees only a very few actually like him res wrote in the new york daily news some respect him some dont many hate his guts

but she said he had a good eye for talent and had several strong women working for him in her heyday he told her she was a killer and that wanting to be liked by her subordinates was a weakness

later he would hire and promote many people with questionable qualifications res wrote in her new york daily news essay i could see over time his growing need to be coddled and agreed with she wrote adding that by the s he had taken to decorating his office with beautiful women

he changed res said in a telephone interview i think it was fame and fortune absolutely

in his book trump wrote i dont know why but i seem to bring out either the best or worst in women

he reiterated that theyre really a lot different than portrayed and far worse than men far more aggressive

he praised their intelligence and said they should be saluted for their tremendous power which most men are afraid to admit they have",0,2364,10922,4/11/2018,Reddit

4153,RORY MCILROY SAYS HE WONT ATTEND OLYMPICS OVER ZIKA CONCERNS  THE NEW YORK TIMES,the summer olympics in rio de janeiro may end up known more for the athletes who are not there than the ones who are the golfer rory mcilroy said wednesday that he would skip the rio games which are set to begin in august because of concerns about the zika virus becoming the   athlete yet to withdraw over the health scare because of doping offenses russias track and field team and bulgarias weight lifting team     rosters that would have included several gold medal contenders     have been told they are not welcome at the rio games some kenyan athletes are also in danger of being barred because of doping mcilroy a hugely popular sports figure who was scheduled to play for ireland joins a growing list of athletes pulling out of the games over zika concerns among them the american cyclist tejay van garderen and the golfers marc leishman of australia and vijay singh of fiji john speraw the coach of the united states mens volleyball team has said he will preserve sperm for a possible future pregnancy before traveling to rio and the spanish basketball star pau gasol has said he is considering doing the same anxiety over zika a   virus linked to severe birth defects has cast a cloud over preparations for the summer games with six weeks to go until the games begin mcilroys decision is expected to intensify the debate over the wisdom of staging the games amid a public health emergency olympic officials have rejected the notion that athletes should not be asked to subject themselves to such health hazards saying the risk is minimal mcilroys decision is a major blow for the olympics and not simply because he is a former world no  and winner of four majors mcilroy  the   european in the world at no  was one of the few   golfers who seemed committed to competing in rio he had gone to the trouble of being vaccinated per travel recommendations     no small inconvenience as the shots left his shoulder numb he said making it uncomfortable to swing a golf club for two days other golfers may follow mcilroy jason day of australia the world no  has expressed reservations about competing in rio because of zika his countryman adam scott a former world no  was among the first to remove himself from consideration for the summer games citing scheduling conflicts the   american jordan spieth ranked no  in the world once wholeheartedly embraced the olympic experience he has been more tempered in his enthusiasm recently but he is expected to compete because he is a brand ambassador for   which is the longest continuous sponsor of the olympics having been aligned with the competition since  still several of the worlds best athletes will be absent on tuesday the president of the international olympic committee thomas bach endorsed the decision by track and fields world governing body to bar russias team from the olympics russia won  medals at the last summer games in  in london bach also called for heightened scrutiny of athletes from kenya where antidoping efforts have been found lacking mcilroys patriotism lured him across the atlantic from his florida home base to watch his countrymen from northern ireland play germany on tuesday in a european championships soccer match and more than most golfers who did not grow up dreaming of olympic glory he seemed to grasp the grandeur of the summer games which have not featured golf since  mcilroy mingled with the worlds athletes in  when he watched his   caroline wozniacki compete in tennis at the london games but circumstances change and mcilroy who is engaged to erica stoll decided the risks of competing in rio outweighed the potential rewards after speaking with those closest to me ive come to realize that my health and my familys health comes before anything else mcilroy said in a statement even though the risk of infection from the zika virus is considered low it is a risk nonetheless and a risk i am unwilling to take  none of the worlds top female golfers have backed out of the olympics even though they ostensibly face a greater health risk the women who do not have as high a profile as the men are perhaps more determined to compete in the olympics because winning a medal carries greater value for them in terms of increasing their exposure the olympics were fraught with complications for mcilroy from the start as a northern irishman he had the choice to compete for britain or ireland in  he earned the animus of people in ireland including those in the golfing union of ireland who had shepherded his development by suggesting that he was leaning toward representing britain because he had always felt more british than irish in  he said if i was a bit more selfish i think it would be an easier decision  he later pledged his allegiance to ireland and when asked in may about his commitment to competing he said he was focused on the bigger picture with golf guaranteed a spot in the olympics for only the next two summer games he said it was imperative that the sport put its best foot forward im not sure if were going to have another opportunity to win a gold medal after that mcilroy said adding its off to a rocky start if we dont do something to change the narrative and get people excited about it im worried what will happen  mcilroys decision to forgo the summer games suggests that however reluctantly he has chosen his own interests over the greater good of developing the game before the wells fargo championship in may mcilroy acknowledged that he had misgivings about going to rio because of the health dangers posed by zika and the crammed golf calendar between sundays conclusion of the united states open and the scheduled start of the mens golf competition at the olympics on aug  the players will contest two majors and a world golf championships event with the ryder cup looming on the   horizon mcilroy who fell out of the top three in the world rankings this week for the first time in  months alluded to the scheduling morass in may when he said i feel like the officials were patting themselves on the back for getting golf in instead of treating the sports inclusion in the olympics as the first step in a marathon of planning since a  decision to add golf to the summer olympics program the reaction of the top players has been lukewarm with four majors the fedex cup playoffs and team events like the ryder cup and the presidents cup to focus on the value of an olympic medal is not the same as it is for swimmers track and field athletes fencers archers and other athletes for whom the olympics is the pinnacle of their sport mcilroy has earned more than  million on the pga tour in the   season without winning an event and has earned well over  million in the same time period on the european tour on which he has won once there is   over the preparedness of every olympic host city but these summer games have presented   concerns including crime an economic crisis that has delayed the completion of olympic infrastructure contaminated water and the suspension of brazils president dilma rousseff that makes it hard to ascertain where the olympic defectors concerns about zika end and where their general worries about rios readiness to serve as a world host begin in a statement the international golf federation the olympic organizing body for golf expressed disappointment with mcilroys decision saying it recognizes that some players will have to weigh personally a unique set of circumstances as they contemplate their participation in golfs historic return to the olympic games  it added the olympics is the worlds greatest celebration of sport and we remain excited about golfs return after a   absence ,0,1320,6265,28/2/2021,Fox News
4154,INDIA HOBBLES THROUGH A CASH CRISIS AND ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS BOOM  THE NEW YORK TIMES,new delhi     for a year ashish kumar mandal scratched out a living selling dumplings on the streets of new delhi for a bit less than  cents a plate until the government banned most of the countrys currency bills last month crushing his   business in desperation the    took a step he had never even contemplated before he offered his customers the option of paying electronically mr mandal is among millions of indians     snack vendors and rickshaw drivers cobblers and   sellers     who are moving swiftly toward a cashless economy fulfilling what prime minister narendra modi now says was one of his objectives in banning   and   notes worth about   and   india is experiencing an acute shortage of bills to replace the   notes that were banned as of nov  and which made up  percent of the countrys currency there have been numerous reports of people waiting in line for hours at banks or a t m s only to find that the machines are out of cash as the public struggles with too few bills in circulation business has fallen in many sectors to a small fraction of what it was before the ban economists warn that indias growth of   percent in the most recent quarter among the fastest of any large economy could take a hit if the cash shortage continues after the currency ban my sales came down sharply said mr mandal who sells dumplings from a handcart in a market in the new ashok nagar neighborhood providing change was a big problem  after a customer suggested that he take electronic payments he downloaded software that allows him to accept such transactions on his phone forty percent of his sales are now conducted electronically he says even merchants who do not have smartphones are contemplating buying one if people are flying in planes how long we can ride on bullock cart asked sunil jaiswal who charges less than  to repair watches in an alley near connaught place the   ban was originally presented as a move to curb corruption counterfeiting and   black money the   cash on which tax is not paid that is estimated to make up as much as   of business transactions in india to be effective the move had to be a closely guarded secret until the last minute to prevent those holding black money from unloading it before the ban went into effect     the morning after the decision was announced as a result the government did not print enough replacement cash in time for the change and it continues to struggle to do so fast enough creating a cash shortage that has strangled large sectors of the economy but indians are switching to electronic payments more rapidly than many experts had predicted and in speaking of the recent currency moves mr modi has begun emphasizing the benefits of a cashless economy over the anticorruption fight across the country about   merchants a day are signing up for indias   mobile payments platform paytm about  times as many as the daily average before the currency decision said vijay shekhar sharma founder and chief executive of paytm and one communications the   behind it since the   ban the number of daily transactions on paytm has grown to nearly six million an increase of  percent and the service is adding half a million users each day mr sharma said earlier we were the innovator now we are the mainstream he said this is the start of the golden age for financial technology companies  more than  million people in india use electronic wallets the finance minister arun jaitley said representing nearly   of the countrys population at the same time the government has tasked banks in the country with adding one million machines in stores to process credit and debit card transactions by march  a   increase from the   million available today the number of credit and debit card machines that have been added since the   ban was put in place is not yet available but icici bank one of indias biggest private lenders says it has detected a sharp increase in demand from merchants processing debit and credit card charges a spokeswoman for icici said that the bank had installed six times as many machines last week as it did on average before the limit on   bills still a p hota managing director and chief executive of the national payments corporation of india an umbrella group for sellers of retail payment systems said that he was skeptical the government could achieve its goal of adding one million new credit and debit card machines in a few months calling it a gigantic task  the infrastructure is not yet in place to process the paperwork involved and to teach merchants how to use the machines he said a merchant will have several legitimate queries like how to reconcile the payments how to get money if there is a problem whom to contact mr hota said there has to be an infrastructure to handle these queries  in part because of increased demand from small and midsize merchants as well as from government departments the number of credit and debit card transactions has soared to  million a day more than three times as many as before november said deepak chandnani managing director for south asia and the middle east of worldline india private limited a division of the french company atos worldline produces about a third of the machines used to process these charges in india one the owner of paytm has hired   employees in the last month  percent more than it had hired in the previous two years the companys founder mr sharma said unable to meet demand from merchants seeking help setting up the systems the company ran newspaper advertisements with instructions to help business owners do it themselves the ads also serve as posters for merchants to advertise that they use paytm saurabh porwal  who sells onions on the roadside in harola market in noida a city near delhi downloaded the paytm app after seeing the newspaper advertisement which he then posted on his stall if you deal in less cash it is less of a problem he says moving toward a cashless economy would carry benefits for the government ensuring that more taxes are paid and providing banks with more reserves to extend loans about  percent of transactions in india last year were made in cash compared with  percent in the united states a joint study by google india and boston consulting group found still those adopting cashless technology are a minority at janpath cloth market in delhi where vendors shout out discounted prices to   only one of more than    shops advertised a cashless system amit maheshwari who sells mens pants displays a white piece of paper on his stall saying in bold type paytm accepted here  after the currency change sales at the shop fell to about  percent of what they were before he said then a customer who was browsing said he would buy some pants if he could use paytm we had no idea what this was mr maheshwari said he taught us how to use it  since adopting paytm sales have risen to  percent of what they were before the currency change he said everybody should use it anybody can use it he said but many vendors around india are still resistant mustkeem ahemad  who sells chicken in harola market says that electronic payment systems are too complex for him how can you pay on a phone only an educated person can do it he said i am illiterate so i just cant do it

talk about them in a knowledgeable way whether i actually had any real and useful knowledge is another thing at least i could talk about these subjects as if i knew what i was talking about time went by and it became more and more apparent to me that knowing a great deal about certain subjects did not necessarily convey a power of operation in them i studied palmistry for some time i knew what all the lines and mounts digits and bracelets and sundry meant i knew which hand meant whatever it meant in relation to the other hand but what i did not have was the single most important element i did not have the intuitive feed i studied the tarot and esoteric astrology and various systems of mind control that hearkened back to earlier times i studied a lot of things because i had a real thirst for arcane information but i lacked the intuitive feel in all of them except esoteric astrology and in the matter of the tarot i did have some amount of facility in the areas where fortune telling was not a consideration i always felt that using the tarot for fortune telling was unfortunate behavior not only did it make you dependent on a method that except in very rare circumstances proved to be both deceptive and inefficient but why seek to read the future when you could change the future meditation on the tarot archetypes will transform your mental state and the very construction of it this meditation will awaken the archetypes in you so that they resonate in your being with the world external to you this doesnt mean difficult conditions will not come upon you what it means is that you will be on a shorter and faster track to illumination of some kind we wont be going into that today i studied and i studied and i studied and i learned to parse and debate and state within the parameters of the science and even in a comparative sense with other sciences but i didnt know anything of value in the sense that i could apply what i had learned to real time accomplishments and achievements in the manifest in a supernatural manner sure this kind of thing happens on a regular basis in my life but not because i have anything to do with it all of this takes me back to the words of the preacher in ecclesiastes vanity all is vanity and there is nothing new under the sun it has taken me more years than i wish it had to learn that only love is worth the pursuit of it and the love of the ineffable is the greatest love of all nothing that i have learned in all of the mystery sciences is the equal of this understanding nor do any of them have anywhere near the value of it here is what i have learned love god i am not speaking in a religions sense because in these times you cant swing a dead cat in a condo closet without hitting a false prophet false prophets come in all sizes they are not all the equal of the antichrist whoever that might be like the pasto and the antipasto a false prophet is anyone who manipulates the emotional and mental bodies of their fellows for personal gain even if that gain is only influence influence of this kind usually transforms into personal profit on some level it might be material gain it might be sexual favors it might be psychopathic gratification of some kind and it can take place in a small country church just as easily as in a mega church or a massive television ministry the aquarian age is upon us and as a result all of the long entrenched and much changed over time religions are on their way out the collective faith of humanity is being shaken to its roots and the old ways are passing away this does not mean that the true teachings of the true teachers will pass away but they will be presented in a new light that is relative to the needs of a new age the aquarian age is supposed to be the age of brotherhood and that tells me that the avatar will appear in the collective human heart where a place has been prepared for it it will not appear where the false self is occupying the space necessary for the indwelling divine to reside one does not need to be a follower or practitioner of any particular dogma or form of ritual one needs only to love the divine who is ones own higher self and the reason for this is that that higher self will draw our true self up into its aura of influence or rather reveal itself to is as our true self we are all divinity in the process of discovery and unfoldment and love is the means and the mechanism that can accomplish this as we reject and expel all of what is false and extraneous in ourselves we make room for the indwelling divine once we have driven all of it out of ourselves the divine will come forth in our hearts and reign over all things from the throne room within i have no further use or need for occult information i am not in the market for anything that is on the market i can be very glib about some of these things because of a very good memory and an analytic mind that has not lost its objectivity and which doesnt play favorites in terms of what i want people to think that is their area of authority and has nothing to do with me but all the glibness and capacity for articulation in the world is not going to serve the deeper needs of humanity it might gain you followers and it might get you on some talk circuit and book signing tours and you can lecture to your hearts content at new age conventions and seminars and youll just be one more tom fool among all the rest of the gleem smiling androids who pander to the gullible the world over it will guaranteed also get you in the kind of trouble for which i will run long distances to avoid put yourself on a pedestal or allow others to do it for you and you might as well paint a target on your back at the same time the divine and his angels and emissaries see all of this they see every montebank and charlatan they see into every sincere and corrupt heart and judgments are passed concerning what phases and states you will be taken through to wake you the hell up i would prefer to sidestep the hard massage of karma upon my being love the ineffable and everything else will take care of itself love the ineffable with all the intensity that you can muster and your intensity will grow and grow success is speedy for the energetic god is watching we need to get into a fluid and continuous mindset of certitude concerning this we need to remind ourselves through every day that god is watching god is looking at the world through our very own eyes we may have convinced ourselves that we alone are seeing and that we alone have access to our mind and heart but this is assuredly not the case god is everywhere after one fashion or another when one has brought their heart and mind to the assurance of the endless presence of god in our being and all around us and yet magically and mystically apart as well then we will begin to resonate with that ubiquitous presence and it will move through us in an active expression of itself there was a saint named st denis  who is the patron saint of paris they cut off his head and he picked it up and put it under his arm and walked off with it do i believe this happened in the exact details given i dont know what i do know is that there have been many similar stories one similar is to be found in autobiography of a yogi look into the tales that are recorded concerning appolonius of tyana the links will take you to a fuller study of his life and many many another unusual character who has walked among us here over the ages some of them had a vast reservoir of occult knowledge and some of them were in possession of divine love some had both i would prefer to be one of those who carries the love of god in my heart and i want for nothing more i dont need to know all of these complexities and these complexities go on and on forever there are just so many of them if you have ever looked into tantra then you have some idea of how intricate the complexities can be i am not equal to the possession of such information as fine a mind as i have i am a simple fellow and i can get into trouble very quickly when i get out of my depth and i have no desire to test those waters so i say to you all seek the source of all knowledge worth having seek the reservoir of immeasurable love seek the source of every good and righteous thing and love it with all the force that is possible for you and anything you do need to know will be given to you at the time you need it seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all else will be added unto you end

4168,JEB BUSH SMOKED MARIJUANA BULLIED OTHER STUDENTS IN HIGH SCHOOL,"former florida gov jeb bush smoked marijuana while in high school a personal use of the drug that stands in contrast to his later political stance on the plant

i drank alcohol and i smoked marijuana when i was at andover bush the current republican frontrunner seeking his partys  presidential nomination told the boston globe as part of a detailed new profile that describes his time at phillips academy in andover massachusetts both george hw bush jebs father and george w bush his brother also attended the prestigious private school

it was pretty common bush said of his substance use during that time a former classmate of bushs peter tibbetts recalled to the newspaper that the first time he ever smoked marijuana was with bush in some woods near their dorm

the first time i really got stoned was in jebs room tibbetts told the globe he had a portable stereo with removable speakers he put on steppenwolf for me tibbetts was eventually forced to leave the boarding school after being accused of using drugs

as a politician bush has not embraced marijuana he spent much of his time as florida governor championing jail instead of treatment for nonviolent drug offenders and pushed for mandatory prison sentences for drug offenders  with the exception of his daughter noelle who has struggled with crack cocaine use

more recently while acknowledging that states should have a right to decide on the legalization of marijuana bush publicly opposed an amendment to legalize medical marijuana in florida

florida leaders and citizens have worked for years to make the sunshine state a worldclass location to start or run a business a familyfriendly destination for tourism and a desirable place to raise a family or retire bush said before the november midterm election allowing largescale marijuana operations to take root across florida under the guise of using it for medicinal purposes runs counter to all of these efforts

you would think hed have a little more understanding then paul who may be a rival to bush in the republican primary told the hill friday he was even opposed to medical marijuana this is a guy who now admits he smoked marijuana but he wants to put people in jail who do

the globe also spoke to some of bushs former classmates who recalled a physically imposing young man who was seen as intimidating by some and a bully by others tibbetts recalled a story to the newspaper of an occasion during their boarding school days when he and bush taunted a smaller student who lived in their dorm by sewing his pajama bottoms so that the student couldnt put them on

bush told the globe he didnt remember the incident or any other bullying and was surprised that some of his former classmates viewed him that way i dont believe that is true bush said adding that it was more than  years ago and not possible for him to remember

it isnt the first time that allegations of bullying have surfaced about bushs high school years another classmate of bushs told vanity fair in  that he remembered bush as a bully as well and that there was a kind of arrogance about him during his time at andover",0,541,2583,27/5/2020,TikTok

4171,COURT REFUSES TO REINSTATE TRAVEL BAN DEALING TRUMP ANOTHER LEGAL LOSS  THE NEW YORK TIMES,washington     a federal appeals panel on thursday unanimously rejected president trumps bid to reinstate his ban on travel into the united states from seven largely muslim nations a sweeping rebuke of the administrations claim that the courts have no role as a check on the president the   panel suggesting that the ban did not advance national security said the administration had shown no evidence that anyone from the seven nations     iran iraq libya somalia sudan syria and yemen     had committed terrorist acts in the united states the ruling also rejected mr trumps claim that courts are powerless to review a presidents national security assessments judges have a crucial role to play in a constitutional democracy the court said it is beyond question the decision said that the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action  the decision was handed down by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in san francisco it upheld a ruling last friday by a federal district judge james l robart who blocked key parts of the travel ban allowing thousands of foreigners to enter the country the appeals court acknowledged that mr trump was owed deference on his immigration and national security policies but it said he was claiming something more     that national security concerns are unreviewable even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections  within minutes of the ruling mr trump angrily vowed to fight it presumably in an appeal to the supreme court see you in court the security of our nation is at stake mr trump wrote on twitter at the white house the president told reporters that the ruling was a political decision and predicted that his administration would win an appeal in my opinion very easily  he said he had not yet conferred with his attorney general jeff sessions on the matter the supreme court remains   and could deadlock a    tie there would leave the appeals courts ruling in place the administration has moved fast in the case so far and it is likely to file an emergency application to the supreme court in a day or two the court typically asks for a prompt response from the other side and it could rule soon after it received one a decision next week either to reinstate the ban or to continue to block it is possible the travel ban one of the first executive orders mr trump issued after taking office suspended worldwide refugee entry into the united states it also barred visitors from seven   nations for up to  days to give federal security agencies time to impose stricter vetting processes immediately after it was issued the ban spurred chaos at airports and protests nationwide as foreign travelers found themselves stranded at immigration checkpoints by a policy that critics derided as   the state department said up to   foreigners visas were canceled in the days immediately after the ban was imposed the world relief corporation one of the agencies that resettles refugees in the united states called the ruling fabulous news for  newcomers who are scheduled to arrive in the next week many of whom will be reunited with family we have families that have been separated for years by terror war and persecution said scott arbeiter the president of the organization which will arrange for housing and jobs for the refugees in cities including seattle spokane wash and sacramento some family members had already been vetted and cleared and were standing with tickets and were then told they couldnt travel mr arbeiter said so the hope of reunification was crushed and now they will be admitted  several democrats said they hoped the appeals court ruling would cow mr trump into rescinding the ban representative karen bass democrat of california said in a statement that the ban is rooted in bigotry and most importantly its illegal  we will not stop ms bass said but some republicans cast aspersions on the ninth circuits decision and predicted that it would not withstand a challenge in the supreme court courts ought not   sensitive national security decisions of the president senator tom cotton republican of arkansas said in a statement this misguided ruling is from the ninth circuit the most notoriously   court in america and the   court at the supreme court he said im confident the administrations position will ultimately prevail  trial judges nationwide have blocked aspects of mr trumps executive order but no other case has yet reached an appeals court the case in front of judge robart in seattle was filed by the states of washington and minnesota and is still at an early stage the appeals court order issued thursday ruled only on the narrow question of whether to stay a lower courts temporary restraining order blocking the travel ban the appeals court said the government had not justified suspending travel from the seven countries the government has pointed to no evidence the decision said that any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the united states  the three members of the panel were judge michelle t friedland appointed by president barack obama judge william c canby jr appointed by president jimmy carter and judge richard r clifton appointed by president george w bush they said the states were likely to succeed at the end of the day because mr trumps order appeared to violate the due process rights of lawful permanent residents people holding visas and refugees the court said the administrations legal position in the case had been a moving target it noted that donald f mcgahn ii the white house counsel had issued authoritative guidance several days after the executive order came out saying it did not apply to lawful permanent residents but the court said that we cannot rely on that statement the white house counsel is not the president the decision said and he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the executive departments it also mentioned the governments shifting interpretations of the executive order in its briefs and in the arguments before the panel on tuesday the justice departments position evolved as the case progressed the administration offered a backup plea for at least a partial victory at most a justice department brief said previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the united states in the future should be allowed to enter the country despite the ban the appeals court ultimately rejected that request however saying that people in the united states without authorization have due process rights as do citizens with relatives who wish to travel to the united states the court discussed but did not decide whether the executive order violated the first amendments ban on government establishment of religion by disfavoring muslims it noted that the states challenging the executive order have offered evidence of numerous statements by the president about his intent to implement a muslim ban  and it said rejecting another administration argument that it was free to consider evidence about the motivation behind laws that draw seemingly neutral distinctions but the court said it would defer a decision on the question of religious discrimination the political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions the decision said for now it is enough for us to conclude that the government has failed to establish that it will likely succeed on its due process argument in this appeal  the court also acknowledged the massive attention this case has garnered at even the most preliminary stages  on the one hand the public has a powerful interest in national security and in the ability of an elected president to enact policies the decision said and on the other the public also has an interest in free flow of travel in avoiding separation of families and in freedom from discrimination  these competing public interests the court said do not justify a stay  the court ruling did not affect one part of the executive order the cap of   refugees to be admitted in the  fiscal year that is down from the   ceiling put in place under president barack obama the order also directed the secretary of state and the secretary of homeland security to prioritize refugee claims made by persecuted members of religious minorities as of thursday that means the united states will be allowed to accept only about   more refugees this fiscal year since oct  the start of the fiscal year   refugees have been admitted   of them syrians,0,1427,7096,16/10/2019,CNN
4172,ERIC TRUMP CHARITY SPENT K AT FAMILYOWNED GOLF RESORTS,"the younger trump swears his foundation gives all of its money away to good causes which is true if you dont count the cash spent on trumpowned resorts or the plastic surgeon

those are some of the beneficiaries of the eric trump foundation an eponymous public charity headed by the republican presidential nominees thirdborn though eric trumpthe executive vice president of development and acquisitions for the trump organization and one of his fathers top surrogates and closest political advisersrecently claimed his father had donated hundreds of thousands to his charity the only available evidence seems to suggest payments in fact went the other way the eric trump foundation etf paying hundreds of thousands over the last  years to host lavish fundraising events at donald trumps golf courses

in promotional videos and press releases etf touts a  to  percent donation ratio and implies that by benefit of being a trump namesake properties are handed over for charity events at little or no cost but according to a daily beast analysis of annual irs reports and new york state financial disclosures from the charitys inception in  to  the most recent year for which data is available etf spent  on its annual golf invitational at trumpowned clubs a portion of which in  and  in was reported as paid directly to a company of a family member of the board of directors in other words donald trump himself

donald trump and his private foundation are already in hot water as reports swirl of suspected selfdealing or using his foundation funds for private gain indeed the man who considers a presidential run as an opportunity to turn a profit made headlines and invited criticism this week after the washington post revealed that the selfprofessed billionaire had reportedly used monies from the donald j trump foundation to pay off  in legal disputes previous reports found donald trump had also used the fundwhich he hasnt personally donated to since to purchase portraits of himself and gift  to florida attorney general pam bondi in a possible quid pro quo to head off an investigation into his shady trump university both of which may have violated federal and state tax laws new yorks attorney general is currently investigating the reports

of course viewed through the prism of his fathers questionable philanthropic practices eric trumps foundation seems downright angelic eric trumps foundation operates with almost no overhead eric neither pays himself nor his board members and relies on trump organization employees who volunteer for whatever the foundation may need most importantly eric trumps charity has over the last  years according to its tax reports raised  million for st jude childrens research hospital a beloved tennesseebased nonprofit that treats children with catastrophic diseases freeofcharge that figure nearly doubles when you include the yearlong fundraisers utilizing trump hotelswhere guests are encouraged to donate and buy special services a percentage of which goes to st judeand employees who both contribute their money and volunteer their time by competing in companywide contests and organizing events like car washes bake sales and walkathons to raise cash that goes straight to the hospitalover  this past year according to etfs executive director paige scardigli

we pride ourselves on having an extremely low expense ratio and that is only made possible by leveraging off the trump assets scardigli wrote in an email to the daily beast trump assets are not profiting from these etf events but instead they are donating their time and resources to the cause

were so lucky as trumps to have the best hotels in the world to have the best golf courses in the world and other great assets and were so lucky to be able to use those assets at our disposal for a great purpose and thats really what etf is eric says in a  video

it sounds like they were just making a number up said elizabeth keating a boston university professor who studies nonprofit finance they should have had a proposal that said these are the costs for which there should be an invoice detailing what the foundation was paying for instead it sounds like the golf course just said give us 

scardigli took the reins as etfs director in january replacing a woman who left the organization after eight months and hers wasnt the only highlevel dropout this year the foundations board of directors and executive committee have each lost a member since march jeffrey lichtenberg a freelance realestate broker and consultant with a history of bid rigging on construction projects and nathan crisp until recently a trump hotels executive who police accused of twice slamming a brooklyn mother to the ground on easter

when asked why the trump organization didnt donate the use of the courses michael cohen a longtime attorney to donald trump and board member on the eric trump foundation said i believe there are certain rules that you do have to pay for certain thingstheyre not marked up its inexpensive i think theres some law that says you have to

trump national golf club westchester where etfs annual event is held did not return a request for event pricing but charities which have held fundraisers at trump clubs showed similar expenses and revenue in their tax reports known as s suggesting eric trump indeed paid a standard ratearound for use of his fathers property tic toc stop a charity dedicated to funding tourette syndrome research paid  for a smaller golf outing in  and according to the boston globe the danafarber cancer institutewhich has held its annual gala at trumps florida club maralago for the last six yearspaid around  for a fundraiser with up to  guests the most recent etf fundraiser boasted  attendees

though the eric trump foundations website says we exclusively support st jude childrens research hospital that isnt the case in  etf began donating in earnest to other causes cutting small checks to  individual charities in addition to the outsize donation given to the childrens hospital some of these small donationslike the  to the american society for enology and viticulture a california wine industry organization where eric trump once gave a keynote addresshave seemingly little to do with the charitys mission of helping sick children

the cats cradle of connections dont end there the gsm fund paid out  that same year for their golf tournamentan annual event held at trumps hudson valley course that cost nearly double what the charity gave out in grants that year they along with at least six other charities that have received donations from the eric trump foundation since  hold fundraising events at trump golf clubs",0,1097,5567,17/12/2020,BBC
4173,OBAMA GETS DESPERATE TELLS AMERICANS TRUMP WILL TOLERATE THE KKK IF PRESIDENT," comments 
the democrats are getting really nervous about trump winning the election theyre trying to do everything that they can to tear him down even more than hillary is already obama even went as far as to say that the kkk will return 
president barack obama wants people in north carolina to vote for hillary clinton so hes warning them that donald trump would tolerate the support of the klu klux klan if hes elected president if you accept the support of klan sympathizers  the klan  and hesitate when asked about that support then youll tolerate that support when youre in office he said 
obama added that trump would disrespect the constitution as president citing the republican nominees vow to put hillary clinton in jail 
you threaten to throw your opponent in jail without any due process  then imagine what youll do when you actually have the power to violate the constitution along those lines obama warned 
obama made his remarks at the university of north carolinachapel hill on wednesday saying that the fate of the world rests on their shoulders 
i hate to put a little pressure on you but the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders he said as the audience laughed the fate of the world is teetering and you north carolina are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction 
obama dismissed all of the negative ads and bad news that hurt hillary clinton as noise and distractions that they should put aside 
every day is just hysteria and overthetop coverage he said admitting that even he was getting tired of politics i understand the feeling i promise you 
he argued that the choice for president was simple because trump was a con artist who was unfit and not ready to be president 
i mean its strange how over time what is crazy gets normalized obama said referring to the multiple controversial statements made by trump during the campaign

4175, FACEBOOK EMPLOYEES ASKED MARK ZUCKERBERG IF THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO STOP TRUMP,earlier this week facebook ceo mark zuckerberg long may he reign praise be his name holy is he we bow down before him subtly denounced racist xenophobic hatemonger donald trump during a keynote speech at the company s annual f conference while he never mentioned trump by name the tech god had plenty to say about trump s nature as i look around the world i m starting to see people and nations turning inward against the idea of a connected world and a global community  zuckerberg told the crowd but then he targeted his verbal beatdown to trump i hear fearful voices talking about building walls  it takes courage to choose hope over fear instead of building walls we can help build bridges instead of dividing people we can connect people we do it one person at a time one connection at time that s why i think the work we re doing together is more important than it has ever been before trump and his moronic horde of jaded hateful teanuts have all said these things and worse it takes courage to choose hope over fear  zuckerberg added  people will always call you naive but it s this hope and optimism that s behind every important step forward zuckerberg s powerful words obviously struck a chord with employees who voted to ask their ceo a very important question in a recent weekly qa do they have a moral obligation to stop trump from rising to power gizmodo reportsevery week facebook employees vote in an internal poll on what they want to ask zuckerberg in an upcoming qa session a question from the march  poll was  what responsibility does facebook have to help prevent president trump in  a screenshot of the poll given to gizmodo shows the question as the fifth most popularit s not particularly surprising the question was asked or that some facebook employees are antitrump the question and zuckerberg s statements on tuesday align with the consensus politics of silicon valley proimmigration protrade proexpansion of the internetthis question could mean many things depending on the level and nature of  help  in the  congressional elections facebook used its considerable influence to convince voters to show up at the polls an estimated  extra people vote unfortunately not many of them were democrats who largely stayed home rather than perform their civic duty hint hint guys thanks to an aggressive oneday campaign that strongarmed users into getting off the couch to head to the polls could facebook wage a similar war on trump by utilizing a similar strategy to inform conservatives that he s the only man in recent history who chances being unfavorably compared to hitler one day would such a thing be ethical no matter the motivating reasonin  the social media giant experimented with manipulating users  emotions in a move that was widely decried by everyone the company removed either all positive or all negative posts from a good number of its users  news feeds in an effort to see how it would affect their emotions technically we have all agreed to this sort of thing when we agreed to the data use policy but no one was warned that they were part of the experiment either the result was as one would expect more negative posts caused people to produce more negative posts more positive led to more positive posts from users and so oncould the same be done with posts about trump would showing people more negative trump posts cause the overall sentiment   even among the most vapid who reside in stupidville   toward trump to shift could they use this method to influence voters once again would it be ethical even if it would accomplish something good gizmodo noteswhat s exceedingly important about this question being raised and zuckerberg s answer if there is one is how facebook now treats the powerful place it holds in the world it s unprecedented more than  billion people use facebook it s where we get our news share our political views and interact with politicians it s also where those politicians are spending a greater share of their budgetsand facebook has no legal responsibility to give an unfiltered view of what s happening on their network facebook can promote or block any material that it wants  ucla law professor eugene volokh told the publication  facebook has the same first amendment right as the new york times they can completely block trump if they want they block him or promote him volokh says that the only way facebook could legally overstep would be to collude with any candidate if they were to choose to stamp out positive trump posts to create a blackout they would have every legal right if they were working with sanders or clinton however it would be a different issue if facebook was actively coordinating with the sanders or clinton campaign and suppressing donald trump news it would turn an independent expenditure protected by the first amendment into a campaign contribution because it would be coordinated and that could be restrictedbut if they re just saying  we don t want trump material on our site  they have every right to do that it s protected by the first amendment it is very clear that facebook could take a number of actions to ensure that trump stays as far from the white house as his fans are from reality but what if zuckerberg decides the company does have a moral obligation unfortunately given the secretive nature of the news feed and their history of manipulating users we likely won t know what if anything he would decide to do   at least not until after it has happenedfeatured image via getty images,1,955,4531,25/10/2020,Facebook

4177,JOHN KERRY SAYS ITS UNCLEAR WHETHER IRAN DEAL IS WITHIN REACH,"sharm elsheik egypt march  reuters  on the eve of fresh talks with iran us secretary of state john kerry said it was unclear whether an interim agreement over its nuclear power program was within reach

i cant tell you whether or not we can get a deal whether we are close kerry told a news conference on saturday in the red sea resort of sharm elsheik where he attended an egyptian investment summit

the purpose of these negotiations is not just to get a deal it is to get the right deal he added

the united states and five other major powers  britain germany france china and russia  will resume negotiations with iran in lausanne switzerland from sunday they hope to clinch a framework agreement by the end of the month

the two sides would then seek to negotiate by june  a final agreement to would curb irans most sensitive nuclear activities for at least  years in exchange sanctions on the islamic republic would gradually end

kerry expressed concern again that a letter to iran last week from republican senators may have undermined the talks the letter warned iran that any deal made by president barack obama might last only as long as he remained in office  a highly unusual intervention in us foreign policymaking

kerry said he would assure iranian negotiators and europeans allies during the upcoming talks that congress did not have the authority to change the deal

as far as were concerned congress has no ability to change an executive agreement kerry said adding that important gaps still remained between the sides

the letter followed a speech to congress earlier this month by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu who warned that obama was negotiating a bad deal with iran republicans invited netanyahu to speak about iran without consulting the white house or democrats

with israel preparing to elect a new government next week kerry said the united states hoped that whatever the outcome it would help push forward the peace process with palestinians

president obama remains committed to a twostate solution kerry said adding he remains hopeful that whatever choice that people of israel make that there will be an ability to be able to move forward on those efforts

he declined to elaborate on the prospects of resuming the talks with an election just days away

peace talks broke down in april  after nine months of negotiations led by kerry with the longstanding goal of a twostate solution no closer

4179,SENATE DEMOCRATS RELENT AVERTING GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN  THE NEW YORK TIMES,washington     senate democrats on friday relented in their flirtation with a government shutdown over a dispute about health care benefits for coal miners and with less than an hour before the midnight deadline the senate approved a measure to fund the government through april the partys willingness to take the nation to the brink of a government shutdown signaled its intention just weeks after its election drubbing in rust belt states to quickly leverage the sorts of issues that propelled donald j trump to victory the house on thursday passed a   spending bill that would keep the government open through late april and extend through that month health care benefits for retired miners who were set to lose them at the end of the year but democrats wanted those benefits to last for a year and slowed down voting on the measure with the threat of rejecting the bill we never intended to shut down the government senator chuck schumer democrat of new york the incoming minority leader said on the senate floor friday evening he added i think weve made our point  senator joe manchin iii democrat of west virginia who led the charge on behalf of the miners said that at the very least he and his colleagues had drawn attention to what coal miners have done for this country  it was unclear what mr manchin and other democrats had gained from the process there was no legislative compromise nor any promise of more money for miners in the future theres no guarantee mr manchin conceded before suggesting that he and other democrats may hold up legislation over the issue next year were going to use every tactic we can  mr manchin faces   in  in a   state asked if he thought the fight over the miners health care would help his chances he said well i sure dont think it hurts  on friday morning the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell republican of kentucky urged his democratic colleagues to approve the spending bill warning that without it the miners would lose their health care at the end of the month this is a good time to take yes for an answer mr mcconnell said he pledged to work to prevent the expiration of the miners health care coverage next year and blamed senate democrats for contributing to the coal industrys plight in the first place late friday senators voted  to  on a procedural measure to advance the spending bill barely pulling it over the line many republicans joined democrats in rejecting it though for various reasons senator rob portman republican of ohio waited until the  votes needed had been cast before voting no soon after about  minutes before the government would have shut down the senate approved the spending bill  to  democrats threat to shut down the government     the sort of intransigence adopted by republicans in the recent past     indicates their willingness to use the few tools available to them to block legislation next year when possible and to bludgeon republicans with populist issues on which they share common ground with mr trump pressing his case on thursday mr manchin said that senators from both parties had campaigned on giving a fair shake to working people its either put up or shut up he said youve asked them to vote for you because of this reason now you have a chance to show them thats why youre here  mr manchin had furiously worked the phones on friday to see how many senators would join him in voting against a procedural measure to advance the   spending bill but he found that many senators like house representatives wanted to avoid a shutdown senators from coal states did want to use the threat of a shutdown to bring renewed attention to the retired miners and set up a push for a longer extension and a more lasting solution in january while democrats now have the opposition party mantle that republicans held through much of the obama presidency the dynamics are different for instance while mr mcconnell distanced himself in the past from republicans like senator ted cruz of texas when they sought to disrupt bills mr schumer stood with mr manchin on thursday night to call for a better deal for the miners mr mcconnell did not prevent the government shutdown of  but in later years he worked harder to stem disputes before they got that far were going to win this fight mr schumer said on thursday we cant predict the exact path but we are going to win this fight because were right  the coal industry has been decimated in recent years with a string of bankruptcies lawmakers from   states as well as the united mine workers of america have pushed for legislation that would protect the health care and pensions of retirees democrats argued that a   extension of miners health care benefits would leave them in limbo ive tweeted   trump senator sherrod brown democrat of ohio said on thursday adding that the dispute over the miners health care was an early test for mr trump in those communities they live in trump often got  percent of the vote mr brown said i would think hed want to help them but so far he hasnt  mr trump has not spoken publicly about the senate dispute and his transition team did not respond to requests for comment but he voiced frequent praise for coal miners during his campaign were going to put our miners back to work mr trump said on friday night at a rally in michigan miners we love our miners  in a twist mr manchin had been scheduled to meet with mr trump on friday the meeting was postponed until monday in addition to the fight over the miners senate democrats spoke out this week on another issue that seemed right out of mr trumps playbook pushing to write into law a permanent requirement that   steel and iron be used in water projects such a requirement had been removed from a water projects bill that the house approved on thursday and democrats insisted without success that it be put back into the legislation the time is now for donald trump to take a stand in support of american workers said senator tammy baldwin democrat of wisconsin wrapping up its work for the year the senate approved the water projects bill early saturday morning the fate of that bill was important to michigans senators as was the approval of the spending bill together the two measures provide funding to flint mich and other communities dealing with   drinking water,0,1099,5146,22/9/2021,Al Jazeera

4195,BOMBING CASE POINTS TO GAPS IN TRUMPS AND CLINTONS ANTITERRORISM PLANS  THE NEW YORK TIMES,washington     there is nothing in donald j trumps or hillary clintons antiterrorism plans that would have had much chance of stopping the bombings in new york and new jersey that ahmad khan rahami is accused of carrying out the subject of how to prevent terrorism will almost certainly be a major topic on monday night when the two presidential candidates face off in their first debate but the truth is that cases like mr rahamis fit neatly into no categories and his journey from childhood immigrant to naturalized citizen to accused terrorist shows that the debate now underway on the campaign trail is too simplistic it fails to address the hardest and most common cause of radicalization in the united states when personal demons morph into ideologically driven violence mr rahami came to the united states from afghanistan as a    and later became a citizen mr trumps insistence in recent days that he has no problem with ethnic profiling might have led to tougher interrogations of mr rahami when he traveled to quetta pakistan the center of taliban power and returned or when he came back from there with a pakistani wife the strongest indication of his leanings came in  when the local police and the f b i investigated mr rahamis fathers claim that his son was a terrorist but finding no evidence the authorities did not act since mr rahami is an american citizen the only way he could have been locked up without being charged was with a detention system similar to the way   were placed in japanese internment camps during world war ii that was a technique mr trump told time magazine in december that he might or might not have supported at the time he added that as undesirable as it would be to revive such an arrangement in an age of terrorism war is tough  mrs clintons approach would be to rely on countermessaging to prevent radicalization and to try to recognize early signs of extremism but no one seems quite certain how mr rahami was radicalized     on the internet during trips to pakistan or perhaps by his new wife and mrs clintons approach even its advocates acknowledge is no guarantee     it tries to stem the tide rather than reverse it mr trump in short has described a policy of keeping potential terrorists out of the country altogether even if that means suspending or violating americas longstanding principles of taking in refugees and not discriminating against immigrants on the basis of their religion mrs clinton in contrast has argued for the vetting of immigrants     about their history or sympathy for radical ideology     but working to counter extremists messages or behavior a core element of mrs clintons counterterrorism strategy has been to build on pilot programs in four communities that among other features offer residents ways to report individuals who could become radicalized or otherwise exhibit troubling behavior the four communities are   paul los angeles boston and montgomery county md in the elizabeth n j neighborhood where mr rahami lived and worked such a program might     or might not     have made a difference in recent years for instance some friends of mr rahamis noticed a significant change in his personality and religious devotion after a trip to afghanistan where he and his relatives are from but there is no evidence that they alerted anyone or expressed any concern mrs clinton aims to set up an   system community by community that builds on a growing number of programs that the obama administration terms countering violent extremism  the aim is not just to rely on religious leaders such as imams to help detect the early signs of radicalization but also to enlist teachers coaches physicians and others who might notice subtle changes in an individuals behavior and perhaps with family and friends intervene mrs clinton also suggested in december that she would accelerate work with technology companies to take radical speech off facebook youtube snapchat and encrypted apps used by terrorists you are going to hear all the familiar complaints freedom of speech she told the brookings institution she suggested those complaints should be dismissed her advisers acknowledge this would not constitute a complete solution     but neither would immigration bans which they view as counter to american values look were never going to be able to identify every potential bad actor solely through a police record or their involvement with other bad actors said daniel benjamin a former state department terrorism coordinator and now a scholar at dartmouth college so having more eyes on this and more awareness within communities is absolutely essential and will have to be a key part of the solution  mr benjamin who is an adviser to the clinton campaign acknowledged tuesday that theres no guarantee that such programs would have identified rahami ahead of time  but he said mr rahamis case and that of a   man who stabbed  people at a mall in st cloud minn before he was shot and killed by an   police officer appear to be examples of fairly dramatic changes in behavior that might have set off alarms  mrs clinton spoke by phone for  minutes on tuesday morning with a group of top national security and counterterrorism advisers about lessons learned from the most recent terrorist attacks and what additional steps a clinton administration would need to take to prevent strikes on american soil according to a summary of the call that the campaign released they also discussed how to ensure that the police and other law enforcement agencies followed up on individuals who had been previously identified as possible threats mrs clinton has called for an intelligence surge to improve information sharing among federal agencies and with foreign partners mrs clinton and her advisers mulled over ways to combat     attacks and online radicalization     without specific direction or enabling from groups like the islamic state or al qaeda     and how we can best balance the right to privacy with this modern national security imperative according to the summary finally the group examined the dangers of inflammatory rhetoric generalizations and expressions of prejudice all of which mrs clinton and her supporters have accused mr trump of using in his social media comments and campaign speeches mr trump has one word for those solutions weak  he argued during the primaries that he would temporarily ban all muslim immigration a position that received withering criticism from his own party he also said he would take out the families of terrorists a violation of international conventions he combined that with what he maintains would be a far more relentless attack on the islamic state including seizing oil in areas where it operates presumably in iraq although most of the oil belongs to iraq and the bush administration always went to some lengths to say it would be preserved for the benefit of the iraqi people not sold by the united states under pressure mr trump amended his approach to saying he would temporarily ban immigration from countries that have been breeding grounds for terrorism he seemed to have afghanistan and pakistan in mind but that definition could easily embrace germany france belgium and britain as well had that program been in effect in  it might have stopped mr rahamis entry into the country as a    or his readmission in  when he and his family were admitted as refugees mr trump said in a rally on tuesday that the lesson of the new york and new jersey bombing attacks was the need for an immigration crackdown these attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country he said attack after attack     from   to san bernardino to orlando     we have seen how failure to screen who is entering the united states puts all of our citizens in great danger  he said mrs clinton was for people pouring in from syria though the   refugees who have come from there this year is a tiny fraction of what european nations have taken in mr trump called for stopping the massive inflow of refugees which hillary clinton is trying to drastically increase ,0,1362,6735,8/5/2021,Reddit
